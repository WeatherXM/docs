## Welcome aboard

WeatherXM is a community-powered weather network that rewards weather station owners and provides accurate weather services to Web3 enterprises.
WeatherXM weather stations are the world’s first to natively support Web3 technologies. They are all-in-one, easy to deploy, energy and communication autonomous, and designed for large-scale deployment.
WeatherXM makes weather-related smart contracts on-chain a reality.
This documentation site attempts to explain various aspects of the WeatherXM project.

**Thank you for supporting WeatherXM!**
