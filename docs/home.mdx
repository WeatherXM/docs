## Getting Started

WeatherXM is a community-powered weather network that rewards weather station owners and provides accurate weather services to Web3 enterprises.
WeatherXM weather stations are the worldâ€™s first to natively support Web3 technologies. They are all-in-one, easy to deploy, energy and communication autonomous, and designed for large-scale deployment.
WeatherXM makes weather-related smart contracts on-chain a reality.

This documentation site attempts to explain various aspects of the WeatherXM project.
