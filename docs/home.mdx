  <h3>WeatherXM Project</h3>
  <p>WeatherXM creates an entirely new weather data economy that rewards people who deploy and maintain weather stations.</p>
    <p>They are all-in-one, easy to deploy, energy and communication autonomous, and designed for large-scale deployment.
    WeatherXM makes weather-related smart contracts on-chain a reality.</p>
    <p>This documentation site attempts to explain various aspects of the WeatherXM project.</p>
