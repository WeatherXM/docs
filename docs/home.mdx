  <h3>WeatherXM Project</h3>
  <p>
    WeatherXM creates an entirely new weather data economy that rewards
    people who deploy and maintain weather stations.
    <br></br><br></br>
    They are all-in-one, easy to deploy, energy and communication autonomous, and designed for large-scale deployment.
    WeatherXM makes weather-related smart contracts on-chain a reality.
    <br></br><br></br>
    This documentation site attempts to explain various aspects of the WeatherXM project.
