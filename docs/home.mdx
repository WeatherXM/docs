<h3>WeatherXM Project</h3>

WeatherXM creates an entirely new weather data economy that rewards people who deploy and maintain weather stations.

They are all-in-one, easy to deploy, energy and communication autonomous, and designed for large-scale deployment.
WeatherXM makes weather-related smart contracts on-chain a reality.

This documentation site attempts to explain various aspects of the WeatherXM project.
