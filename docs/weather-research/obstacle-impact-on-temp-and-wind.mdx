# Obstacle Impact on Temperature and Wind

We installed two weather stations on a rooftop to investigate how nearby walls and other obstacles might affect weather measurements.

One station, our **reference station** (considered the reliable installation, see Figure 1, Station A - WS1000), was placed at the highest point of the roof, where there were no obstacles taller than the station that could interfere with its readings.

The second station, the **“obstructed” installation** in our experiment (see Figure 1, Station B - WS1001), was placed in a location (see Figure 3) where:

- To the east, a wall 3 m taller than the station is located 5 m away (instead of 21–30 m as suggested by WMO).
- To the west-northwest, a small structure at a similar height as the station, with solar water heaters adding 2 m in height, is located ~5 m away.
- To the northwest, a triangular wall 2 m taller stands 8–9 m away.
- The south-southwest horizon is relatively open.
- The southern horizon is completely open.

For the data analysis, we used **air temperature, wind speed and direction, and solar irradiance**.
- For temperature, we used summer data (10/05/2025–10/08/2025), when urban surfaces are more thermally stressed.
- For wind, we used a longer time series (10/11/2024–10/08/2025) to provide a larger sample.

## Temperature Impact

Although wind samples are not evenly distributed across directions (due to local climatology), clear patterns emerge (Figure 2):

- **Positive temperature biases** (90th percentile: 0.34–0.99 °C) occur when wind comes from directions with obstacles (N, NE, E, SW, W, NW).
- Graphs suggest larger positive deviations when the **sun is in the southern or southwestern sky** (solar azimuth). At this azimuth, east-facing walls receive maximum solar radiation, increasing heating.
- For winds from the **south and southeast**, temperature differences are usually negative or close to zero (−0.92 °C to −0.13 °C).

This can be explained as follows:
- When wind is blocked, stored heat in walls is not dispersed, warming sheltered air.
- When wind flows toward obstacles, it removes heat, cooling the air.

Negative deviations may also reflect sensor differences or surface effects: south of Station B there is no concrete (it is at the edge of a five-story building), while south of Station A, concrete rooftop surfaces emit extra heat.

Air tends to acquire thermodynamic properties of the surfaces it passes over. Even though distances are small, under **low wind conditions** the air can linger and pick up new thermal characteristics.
However, unequal sample sizes per wind direction reduce confidence in these conclusions.

## Wind Impact

The effects on wind are clearer (Figures 3–5):

- **North to east-southeast winds (0–135°):** Station B shows significantly lower speeds (up to >1.5 m/s), especially from ENE, where the main wall is located.
- **East-southeast:** Wind speed at Station B recovers somewhat but remains lower, due to obstacle influence and averaging effects (1-min averages).
- **West to west-northwest (225–292.5°):** Speeds reduced by up to 1 m/s, despite seemingly smaller obstacles.
- **South sector:** No obstacles → comparable wind speeds at both stations.
- **North and NNW:** Less impact, since obstacles are further away and discontinuous, with openings that sometimes allow airflow.
- **Overall:** Station B consistently records lower speeds, even in free-horizon directions. Likely causes:
  - Proximity to rooftop → stronger friction.
  - Southerly winds may be deflected upward by the building before reaching the sensor.
