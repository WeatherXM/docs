##  <Highlight color="#68a4f9">Data</Highlight>

   

  ### Is there a chance for my host/friend to be able to have access at my station's data?

  Yes! It was a common feature request so we have implemented it. You can share your station's data with your friends by using the share button on the station's page on the [explorer](https://explorer.weatherxm.com/). Also, you can "favorite" any station you like by clicking on the heart shaped button while using our mobile App.
  The station will appear in your station list.
    

  <hr />

### How do you know people are not faking the location of their station on the map?

In addition to the cryptographic proofs from all station data sent to the WeatherXM Network, we have designed and implemented a unique Proof of Location algorithm to safeguard the accuracy of the weather station location. Read more at the [PoL section of the documentation](/project/proof-of-location).




  ## <Highlight color="#68a4f9">Hardware</Highlight>

  
  ### Can I connect my WXM station with a 3rd party station?

  Our weather stations are custom built, they are developed to connect to our network with our firmware and software implementations. The SDR receiver is no longer on our roadmap.
  
  <hr />

  ### What are the differences between the WXM WiFi M5 station and the WXM Helium compatible station?

  <ol>
    <li>The Helium station has an integrated (located within the weather station) Helium-compatible LoRaWAN chip, crypto chip, and GPS while the Wi-Fi bundle has a Wi-Fi gateway, crypto chip, and GPS located within the external M5 gateway. </li>
    <li>Helium station can only connect to the Helium Network while the Wi-Fi bundle can only connect to Wi-Fi.</li>
    <li>The Helium station has a larger solar panel which allows it to do processing standalone (in the station itself) while the Wi-Fi bundle's station has a smaller solar panel since the processing is done by the external M5 display and Wi-Fi gateway (located indoors) which the station communicates to over LoRa.</li>
    <li>The Helium bundle does not contain any type of display to view weather data. Weather data will have to be viewed from the WeatherXM app.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <hr />

  ### Can I connect my Helium compatible station to any Helium around or should I request access from someone?

  You can connect your Helium compatible station anywhere with Helium network coverage or near a Helium gateway. The gateway that will handle your packet is usually the fastest to respond but this is influenced by numerous factors. This means that the closest Helium gateway will not necessarily be the one that will pick up your packet, nor your can choose or influence this.

  <hr />

  ### Will it make a big difference if I place my station on the balcony instead of the roof?

  It is mandatory that you place your station on the roof and the reason is because there aren't so many obstacles as there are on a balcony (e.g walls), that will reduce the quality of your data, therefore the amount of your rewards. 
  You can also check the [deployment examples](/deployment-examples) for inspiration.
  
  <hr />

 
  ### Is any of your stations suitable for very cold climates? 

  For very cold climates that have snow most of the year, we will be launching soon a special weather station with a heater suitable for these weather conditions. 
 
  <hr />

  ### Which is the recommended frequency for my country?

  We approximately follow the [frequency assignments of TTN per country](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country/).


## <Highlight color="#68a4f9">Rewards</Highlight>

 
  ### How can I start receiving rewards?

  If you have already set up your station and claimed your device via the app, please add Metamask and follow the instructions [here](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address) and then follow this guide to [claim your rewards](/project/rewards-claiming).
  
  <hr />

  ### When will mainnet launch?

  The WXM token will be live in mid to end of February 2024!!

  <hr />

  ### Will testnet tokens be converted to real tokens after token launch?

  Testnet tokens don't have any value and are used for testing purposes. Upon Token Launch a  "beta rewards program" will begin where you will be able to earn some extra tokens for your contributions to the network. You can read more details in our blog post [here](https://blog.weatherxm.com/beta-user-rewards-b2e27b1727d7). 
  
  <hr />

  ### Do I have to pay for the HNT/DC fees?

  We are covering the HNT/DC fees.
  
<hr />

  ### Can I change my wallet address in the future?

  For now we support only MetaMask as it has a very good testnet support and our dev team prefer it. When we move on Mainnet you will be able to use your preferable wallet.

<hr />

  ### How many stations are allowed in a Hex?

  Such details will be defined in our [whitepaper](https://weatherxm.com/whitepaper).

<hr />
