# Reward Algorithm

Rewarding the members of our network for sharing their local weather data is a crucial part of our system (**currently on testnet**).

Our **Reward Algorithm** is a unique, fair and transparent algorithm that will handle how rewards are being distributed to the network members.

We are currently on the first iteration of that algorithm that has been implemented in a naive way that takes into account only
if any given weather station is connected or not in our network.

There are 3 steps on the algorithm:
  - The minting of the WXM Testnet tokens
  - The validation of the weather stations and their weather data
  - The reward distribution


:::note Important
Connecting a wallet is mandatory for getting rewards. If a user has not connected a wallet, the rewards will be lost.

## How Often does the Reward Algorithm runs?
It runs daily for the day before.

## Validation
`validation_score = array_of_hourly_weather_data / 24`

### Explanation
In the validation step, the algorithm takes for any given weather station its weather data for each hour of the previous day.
  - If the weather station has successfully sent data for each hour the previous day, then the algorithm's input is an array of 24 objects
  with each object being the station's weather data.
  - If the weather station hasn't sent any weather data for 1 or more hours of the previous day then the algorithm's input is an array of (24 - X) objects
    with each object being the station's weather data and `X` being the amount of hours that the station hasn't communicated with our system.

That input is then being used by dividing its length with 24 (the maximum hours per day) to get a `validation_score` of `0.0` to `1.0`.

## Reward distribution
`weather_station_reward = validation_score * max_daily_reward`

### Explanation
After the validation step, the algorithm takes the `validation_score` for any given weather station in our network,
multiplies it with the `max_daily_reward` that the weather station can get and the result is the amount of the WXM tokens
that the algorithm distributes to the user who owns that weather station.

:::note
As stated before, this is a naive first iteration. Our current plans are that in the future our algorithm will take into weighted consideration the following:
  - Location Coverage (density of weather stations in an area)
  - Weather Data Quality
