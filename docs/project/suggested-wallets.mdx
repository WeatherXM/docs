While we are on the testnet, we want to use a **MetaMask** wallet with WeatherXM. By following our guide, it's 
fairly simple to set up a MetaMask wallet and add a custom token (in our case, the WXM token) on Polygon's testnet.

:::note
The following guide has been written with the **MetaMask browser extention** in mind.
The steps may vary on other platforms.
:::

## MetaMask

MetaMask is a crypto wallet app and browser extension.

:::caution
Only install this wallet from the [official MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download/)!
:::


### Installing and setting up MetaMask

1. MetaMask is available to download and install on Chrome, iOS, and Android through the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download/).
Always check if you are using the official website to make sure you’re installing the real MetaMask extension.
1. After installing the extension, you’ll be greeted with the MetaMask welcome page. Click [Get Started] to begin.
1. If you’re creating a new wallet, click the [Create a Wallet] button. You can also import an existing wallet using its seed phrase with the [Import wallet] option.
1. MetaMask will ask you if you’d like to share anonymous usage data with them to help improve the extension. Accepting or refusing this will not affect your MetaMask usage.
1. Choose a secure password to log in to your wallet from your browser. Note that this is not your seed phrase. The password is a security measure to prevent anyone using your device from accessing your wallet.
  If you forget your password, you can always access your crypto with your seed phrase.
1. After choosing your password, MetaMask will present you with information regarding your wallet’s seed phrase. Make sure to read through it if you aren’t familiar with how a crypto wallet works.
1. You’ll now be presented with your seed phrase. Click the lock to view the words and take note of them in the correct order. Keep the phrase in a secure place (preferably offline) and never share it with anyone.
  This string of words is the final backup of your wallet and its contents. Click [Next] to continue.
1. You’ll now have to repeat your seed phrase by selecting the words at the bottom of the screen in the right order. Click [Confirm] once this is complete.
1. Your MetaMask wallet will now be set up and ready to use. Click [All Done] to view your wallet.

## Add Polygon Network

Adding Polygon Network support to MetaMask is a mandatory step in order to add the WXM token, view activity, and make transactions.
Make sure you follow our step-by-step guide below for adding the Polygon Network to MetaMask.

We will provide guidance for both Polygon Mainnet and Mumbai Testnet but
as we are currently in testnet, **you need to add the Mumbai Testnet network.**

There are two ways to do it:

1. [Using Polygonscan](/suggested-wallet#using-polygonscan) **(Only for Desktop with MetaMask browser extension already installed)**
1. [Add the Polygon network manually](/suggested-wallet#add-the-polygon-network-manually)

### Using Polygonscan

:::note
Please make sure you have already installed **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)**!

**This solution works only on desktop with the MetaMask browser extension already installed.**
:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mumbai"
  values={[
    { label: 'Polygon-Mainnet', value: 'mainnet', },
    { label: 'Mumbai-Testnet', value: 'mumbai', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="mainnet">

:::note
This is just for informational purposes. At this stage we are currently in testnet so **you will need to add the Mumbai Testnet network.**

If you face any issues, **Add the Network Manually (steps given below)**

### Add the Polygon network manually

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mumbai"
  values={[
    { label: 'Polygon-Mainnet', value: 'mainnet', },
    { label: 'Mumbai-Testnet', value: 'mumbai', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="mainnet">

:::note

To add Polygon’s Mainnet, click on the Network selection dropdown and then click on Custom RPC.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/project/suggested-wallets/select-network.png")} />

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/project/suggested-wallets/metamask-settings-mainnet.png")} />

Once you’ve added the information, click on Save. You will be directly switched to Polygon’s Mainnet now in the network dropdown list. You can now close the dialog.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**You have successfully added the Polygon Network to your MetaMask!**

## Add WXM in MetaMask

For the WXM token to appear in the wallet UI, you will need to add it manually.
Note that your wallet can still receive tokens that haven’t been imported.

:::note IMPORTANT NOTE
Please make sure you have already added the **Mumbai-Testnet** and have connected to it by following the guide above!
:::

1. First, you will need the following details of the WXM token in order to add it:
    1. **Token Contract Address:** ``0xeCbbbF304fdf91cdDDA6C6643ED1300A552b691A``
    1. **Token Symbol:** ``WXM``
    1. **Token Decimal:** ``18``

You can verify those details on [PolygonScan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/token/0xecbbbf304fdf91cddda6c6643ed1300a552b691a).

2. On MetaMask and click **[Import tokens]**.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/project/suggested-wallets/metamask-import-tokens.png")} />

3. Paste in the WXM’s contract address and MetaMask should automatically fill in the rest of the details. If not, add them manually. To finish, click **[Add Custom Token]**.

4. Click **[Import Tokens]**.

**You have now successfully added the WXM token to your MetaMask wallet!**
