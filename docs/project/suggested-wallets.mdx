# Suggested Wallets

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

As we are still in testnet, we connecting a **MetaMask** wallet with WeatherXM. That is because by following
our guide is fairly easy to use the Polygon's testnet on MetaMask and add a custom token (in our case, the WXM).

## MetaMask

MetaMask is a crypto wallet app and browser extension.

:::note
Download this wallet only from the [official MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download/)!
:::

### Installing and setting up MetaMask

1. MetaMask is available to download and install on Chrome, iOS, or Android through the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download/).
Always check if you are using the official website to make sure you’re downloading the real MetaMask extension.
1. After downloading and installing the extension, you’ll be greeted with the MetaMask welcome page. Click [Get Started] to begin.
1. If you’re creating a new wallet, click the [Create a Wallet] button. You can also import an existing wallet using its seed phrase with the [Import wallet] option.
1. MetaMask will ask you if you’d like to share anonymous usage data with them to help improve the extension. Accepting or refusing this will not affect your MetaMask usage.
1. Choose a secure password to log in to your wallet from your browser. Note that this is not your seed phrase. The password is a security measure to prevent anyone using your device from accessing your wallet.
  If you forget your password, you can always access your crypto with your seed phrase.
1. After choosing your password, MetaMask will present you with information regarding your wallet’s seed phrase. Make sure to read through it if you aren’t familiar with how a crypto wallet works.
1. You’ll now be presented with your seed phrase. Click the lock to view the words and take note of them in the correct order. Keep the phrase in a secure place (preferably offline) and never share it with anyone.
  This string of words is the final backup of your wallet and its contents. Click [Next] to continue.
1. You’ll now have to repeat your seed phrase by selecting the words at the bottom of the screen in the right order. Click [Confirm] once this is complete.
1. Your MetaMask wallet will now be set up ready to use. Click [All Done] to view your wallet.

## Add Polygon network

Adding Polygon support to MetaMask is a mandatory step if you want to add the WXM token, view the activity and do some transactions.
Make sure you follow our step-by-step guide below for adding Polygon Network to MetaMask.

We will provide guidance for both Polygon Mainnet and Mumbai Testnet but
as we are currently in testnet, **you need to add the Mumbai Testnet network.**

There are two ways to do it:

1. [Using Polygonscan](/suggested-wallet#using-polygonscan) **(Only for Desktop with MetaMask browser extension already installed)**
1. [Add the Polygon network manually](/suggested-wallet#add-the-polygon-network-manually)

### Using Polygonscan

:::note
Please make sure you have already installed **[Metamask](https://metamask.io/)**!

**This solution works only in Desktop with the MetaMask browser extension already installed.**

    { label: 'Mumbai-Testnet', value: 'mumbai', },

## Add WXM in MetaMask

For the WXM token to appear on the wallet UI, you will need to add them manually.
Note that your wallet can still receive tokens that haven’t been imported.

1. First, you will need the following details of the WXM token in order to add it:
    1. **Token Contract Address:**
    1. **Token Symbol:**
    1. **Token Decimal:**

You can verify those details on PolygonScan.

2. On MetaMask and click **[Import tokens]**.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/project/suggested-wallets/metamask-import-tokens.png")} />

3. Copy in the WXM’s contract address and MetaMask should automatically fill in the rest of the details. If not, add them manually. To finish, click **[Add Custom Token]**.

4. Click **[Import Tokens]**.

You have now successfully added the WXM token in your MetaMask wallet.
