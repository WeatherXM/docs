## Introduction

WeatherXM is built on an EVM compatible chain (we are currently developing on [Arbitrum One](https://arbitrum.io/) but this will be finalized near token launch), and rewards weather station owners with the WXM token. WeatherXM intends to be the world's largest, most distributed, and most decentralized weather network.

You can view the current state of the network on our [explorer](https://explorer.weatherxm.com).

As it is clearly stated above this is a basic first iteration. In the future, our algorithm will take into weighted consideration the following:

- Location Coverage (density of weather stations in an area)
- Weather Data Quality

More on how rewards are split among network participants will be announced soon.
