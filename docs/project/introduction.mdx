## Introduction

WeatherXM is based on an EVM compatible chain - we are currently developing on Polygon but this will be finalized near token launch - and we will reward the weather station owners in the WXM token. Launched in August of 2021 as currently in beta phase, WeatherXM plans to be the largest, most distributed and most decentralized weather network in the world.

You can view the current state of the network at our [explorer](https://explorer.weatherxm.com).

The members of our network will get rewarded for sharing their local weather data based on a unique and fair algorithm. The algorithm takes into weighted consideration:

- Location Coverage (density of weather stations in an area)
- Weather Data Quality

More on how rewards are split among network participants to be announced soon.
