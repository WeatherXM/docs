## Introduction

WeatherXM is built on an EVM compatible chain (we are currently developing on Polygon, but this will be finalized near token launch) and will reward weather station owners with the WXM token. WeatherXM intends to be the world's largest, most distributed, and most decentralized weather network.

You can view the current state of the network on our [explorer](https://explorer.weatherxm.com).

The members of our network will get rewarded for sharing their local weather data based on a unique and fair algorithm. The algorithm takes into weighted consideration:

- Location Coverage (density of weather stations in an area)
- Weather Data Quality

More on how rewards are split among network participants will be announced soon.
