**Cell Capacity (CC)** is a parameter that is used to define the maximum number of stations that may receive rewards in a specific cell.

Each cell has a predefined cell capacity that depends on its geospatial characteristics. 
The cell's capacity is the maximum number of stations that may receive rewards in a specific cell. 
If 'N' weather stations are rewardable in a cell with a capacity CC during a specific day, if N>CC, then only the first N stations (ordered first by their rewards score defined below, and then by seniority) will receive rewards.

### Last Claim Time (LCT): 
Claim time is a unix timestamp (integer).
Last Claim Time is set to the timestamp of the last claim of the station. It is used as a seniority indicator ( LCT1<LCT2 then station 1 is more senior than station 2).
