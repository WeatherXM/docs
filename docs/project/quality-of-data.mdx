QoD is an algorithm evaluates the quality of weather data provided by a weather station. 
The score calculated indicates the confidence level about the quality of the weather data received by a station. 
We need meaningful and usable data and the QoD score is an attempt to quantify this metric. 
The end goal is to encourage weather station owners to do their best to comply with the Network's guidelines in order to consistently 
achieve the best QoD score possible.

QoD is a rational number in the range [0,1]

Actually, It’s the method we use to assess the quality of each data point we receive from WeatherXM stations. 
QoD involves a series of techniques and processes designed to help us distinguish between expected and unexpected data behaviors.

QoD algorithm, Version 1 (v1), boasts the ability to handle time series data with varying intervals and can process data from weather stations with different capabilities and specifications. 
It includes two types of checks:

#### Out-of-Bounds Checks (OBC): 
These identify values that fall outside the limits specified by the manufacturer of each sensor.
#### Self-Quality Checks (SQC): 
These are on the lookout for unnaturally flat values, spikes or drops in reported measurements, and lack of sufficient data to compute an average.
The outcome of this process is an hourly report for each station, offering two key pieces of information:

- the percentage of valid data points reported 
- text annotations per meteorological variable (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, and illuminance) that describe issues in data quality.

#### QoD v1 represents a major milestone for us, serving a dual purpose.

Firstly, it empowers us to build an “enhanced dataset” exclusively comprised of data that meet specific quality criteria. This enhanced dataset is incredibly valuable for the commercial applications of WeatherXM data.

Secondly, it provides a transparent and verifiable mechanism for assigning a daily QoD score to each station. 
This score plays a key role in our station rewards system: Stations providing high-quality data receive full rewards, while those with lower QoD scores get less.

This is a very high-level, quite simplified, overview of the process.
If you’re eager to dive into the nitty-gritty details, including how we handle varying data rates, or out-of-bounds and self quality checks,

### Quality-of-Data Threshold (QoD_Threshold): 
QoD_Threshold is a rational number in the range [0,1]
This number indicates the minimum QoD score a station must have on a given day in order to be eligible for rewards.


### Quality-of-Data v1.5 
additionally includes: 

- ISD (Indoors Station Detector) witch detects stations that have not been deployed outdoors by analysing and comparing observed and theoretical solar irradiance.

The ISD process results in a unique daily score that is 0 for a weather station that was detected to be indoors and 1 for an outdoor weather station. 
To conserve and manage our computational resources more efficiently, stations receiving a value of 0 from the ISD process are excluded from the OBC-SQC process.
