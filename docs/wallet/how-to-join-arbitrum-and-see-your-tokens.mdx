If you don’t have a wallet, [create one](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address#how-to-create-wallet-on-metamask) which is recommended if you want to see test tokens.

### Add Arbitrum Network to Metamask

Adding Arbitrum Network support to MetaMask is a mandatory step in order to add the WXM token, view activity, and make transactions.
Make sure you follow our step-by-step guide below for adding the Arbitrum One Network to MetaMask.

We will provide guidance for both Arbitum Mainnet and Testnet (also called Sepolia Testnet) but
as we are currently in testnet, **you need to add the Testnet network.**


<hr/>

### Using Arbiscan

:::note
Please make sure you have already installed **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)**!

**This solution works only on desktop with the MetaMask browser extension already installed.**
:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mainnet"
  values={[
    { label: 'Arbitrum One Mainnet', value: 'mainnet', },
    { label: 'Arbitrum One Testnet (Sepolia)', value: 'Sepolia', },
  ]
}>

<TabItem value="mainnet">

:::note
This is just for informational purposes. At this stage we are currently in testnet so **you will need to add the Testnet network.**
:::

Please follow the steps to add Arbitrum One Mainnet:

- Navigate to [Arbiscan.io](https://arbiscan.io/)
- Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the button `Add Arbitrum One Network`

<img class="marginTopBottomNormal" src={useBaseUrl("/img/wallet/Arbitrum-One.png")} alt="Arbitrum One" />

- Once you click the button you will see a MetaMask notification, now click on **Approve**.
You will be directed to Arbitrum's Mainnet in the network dropdown list. You can now close the dialog.

### Add WXM token in MetaMask

For the WXM token to appear in the wallet UI, you will need to add it manually.
Note that your wallet can still receive tokens that haven’t been imported.

:::note IMPORTANT NOTE
Please make sure you have already added the **Sepolia-Testnet** and have connected to it by following the guide above!
:::

1. First, you will need the following details of the WXM token in order to add it:
    1. **Token Contract Address:** ``0xbacef2640862B42eECcFeAb9Bf750476aE7decc6``
    1. **Token Symbol:** ``WXM``
    1. **Token Decimal:** ``18``

You can verify those details on [Sepolia Arbiscan](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0xbacef2640862b42eeccfeab9bf750476ae7decc6).


2. On MetaMask and click **[Import tokens]**.

<img src={useBaseUrl("/img/wallet/add_WXM_toMetamask.png")} />

3. Paste in the WXM’s contract address and MetaMask should automatically fill in the rest of the details. If not, add them manually. To finish, click **[Add Custom Token]**.

4. Click **[Import Tokens]**.

**You have now successfully added the WXM token to your MetaMask wallet!**
