### Add Polygon Network

Adding Polygon Network support to MetaMask is a mandatory step in order to add the WXM token, view activity, and make transactions.
Make sure you follow our step-by-step guide below for adding the Polygon Network to MetaMask.

We will provide guidance for both Polygon Mainnet and Testnet (also called Mumbai Testnet) but
as we are currently in testnet, **you need to add the Testnet network.**

There are two ways to do it:

1. [Using Polygonscan](/wallet/how-to-join-on-testnet-and-see-your-tokens#using-polygonscan) **(Only for Desktop with MetaMask browser extension already installed)**
1. [Add the Polygon network manually](/wallet/how-to-join-on-testnet-and-see-your-tokens#add-the-polygon-network-manually)

<hr/>

### Using Polygonscan

:::note
Please make sure you have already installed **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)**!

**This solution works only on desktop with the MetaMask browser extension already installed.**

### Add WXM token in MetaMask

For the WXM token to appear in the wallet UI, you will need to add it manually.
Note that your wallet can still receive tokens that haven’t been imported.

:::note IMPORTANT NOTE
Please make sure you have already added the **Mumbai-Testnet** and have connected to it by following the guide above!
:::

1. First, you will need the following details of the WXM token in order to add it:
    1. **Token Contract Address:** ``0xeCbbbF304fdf91cdDDA6C6643ED1300A552b691A``
    1. **Token Symbol:** ``WXM``
    1. **Token Decimal:** ``18``

You can verify those details on [PolygonScan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/token/0xecbbbf304fdf91cddda6c6643ed1300a552b691a).

2. On MetaMask and click **[Import tokens]**.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/project/suggested-wallets/metamask-import-tokens.png")} />

3. Paste in the WXM’s contract address and MetaMask should automatically fill in the rest of the details. If not, add them manually. To finish, click **[Add Custom Token]**.

4. Click **[Import Tokens]**.

**You have now successfully added the WXM token to your MetaMask wallet!**
