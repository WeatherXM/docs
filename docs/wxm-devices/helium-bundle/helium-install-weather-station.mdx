## Prerequisites for proper installation
1. Pole of at least 2 meters / 6.5ft (not included)
1. Base or bolts to secure in place (not included)
1. Location and spacing (best practices for proper station installation)

:::caution
It is imperative that you properly install your weather station. This will create the necessary conditions for quality weather data collection, which are required for the purpose of the WeatherXM network and the resulting rewards. Faulty installation, will result in less to none WXM rewards.

### Best practices for proper station installation

It is very important that your weather station collects quality measurements.
This turns the weather station into a powerful tool for yourself and WeatherXM.

The values of the various meteorological parameters measured by a weather station can significantly differ depending on the obstacles
and the material of the surfaces existing around the sensors. For this reason, there is a series of criteria that should be fulfilled:

### Pole's Height

<div class="explanation horizontal">
    <p>
      The pole’s height, on which the weather station will be mounted, should be at least 2m/6.5ft.
      This means that the weather station should be placed at least 2m/6.5ft above the ground and any other horizontal
      or almost horizontal surface (e.g., roof) above the station. The maximum acceptable pole height is 5m/16.5ft.
    </p>

  </div>
</div>

### Tighten Pole

<div class="control">
  <div class="copy">
    <p>
      The pole should be adequately tightened in order to prevent any pole oscillations in cases of strong winds.
      This will prevent the rain gauge spoon from swinging and collecting faulty precipitation measurements.
    </p>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>
<hr/>

### Installation Point

The pole together with the weather station should be placed in an installation point, which is:

  <h4>1. Away from heat sources</h4>
  <p>
    Is not affected by the air or smoke flowing out of any chimney or ventilation system
    (as an illustration, consider that wind of a certain direction may move warm smoke towards the station).
    An advisable distance from a heat source is >5 meters/16.4ft.
  </p>

  </section>

  <section class="explanation horizontal">
    <div class="copy">
      <h4>2. Does not get in shadowed areas</h4>
      <p>
        Is not shadowed by any obstacle during the day (consider that the sun is typically higher during summer and lower during winter affecting the shadow caused by an item).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="images">

      <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/ws1000-shadow-soft.svg")} />
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="explanation horizontal">
      <h4>3. Adequate Distance</h4>
      <p>Has a distance from any obstacle around, which 2-4 times larger than the height of the highest obstacle
         (e.g., if the highest obstacle around the installation point is a 6m/20ft tree, ht=6m/20ft,
         and the pole of the weather station is 2m/6.56ft, hp=2m/6.56ft, then the pole should be placed at a distance (dp) of 8-16m/26-52ft,
         2 x (ht-hp) &#60; dp &#60; 4 x (ht-hp). In case the pole is placed on a building’s roof,
         then the building’s height should be added to the pole’s height).
         Note that in cases of obstacles with a height >8m/26ft, you should consider placing the weather station
         at a distance 30 times the width and 15 times the height of the obstacles around.

while 3. is important for avoiding faulty precipitation and wind measurements.

### Direction Alignment

<div class="explanation">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/direction-alignment.svg")} />
    <p>
    Install the weather station in an open location with no obstructions above and around the
    sensor for accurate rain and wind measurement.
    Locate the North (N) marker on top of the weather station and align the marker to point North
    upon final installation with a compass or GPS. Tighten the mounting bracket around a 30-60mm 
    or 1.1-2.36in diameter pole (not included) using the two screws and nuts provided.
    Use the bubble level on the weather station to make sure the sensor is completely level for
    proper measurement of precipitation, wind direction, UV and light intensity.
    </p>

### Install the Pole Mounting Stand - Mounting Clamp (**Not recommended**)

    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/mounting-pole-installation-correct-2.svg")} />
</div>

:::note
Use this method of installation only if an existing pole is of a larger diameter than the pole socket of the weather station.

    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/mounting-pole-installation-false-2.svg")} />
</div>

:::caution
This installation method will lead to poor quality data sharing and the rewards will be reduced.

** Step 1: ** Fasten the plastic pole onto your fix pole with mounting base, clamp, washers, screws and nuts. Following below sequences:

- Insert the plastic pole into the hole of the mounting stand and then secure it with the screw and nut.

- Apply 2 rubber pads on the mounting clamp.

- Fasten the mounting stand and clamp it together onto the fix pole with 4 long screws and nuts.


** Step 2: ** Apply 2 rubber pads on the inner sides of the mounting base and clamp of the weather station and loosely fasten them together.

** Step 3: ** Place the weather station over the mounting pole and align it to north direction before fastening the screws.

</div>

:::caution
- Any metal object can attract lightnings, including the mounting pole. Never install the weather station on stormy days.
- If you want to install a weather station on a house or building, consult a licensed electrical engineer to ensure proper grounding. Direct lightning impact on a metal pole can damage or destroy your home.
- Installing the sensor at a high location may result in personal injury or death. Perform as many initial inspections and operations as possible on the ground and in buildings or houses. Only install the weather station on clear, dry days.
