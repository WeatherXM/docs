## Prerequisites for proper installation
1. Pole of at least 2 meters / 6.5ft (not included)
1. Base or bolts to secure in place (not included)
1. Location and spacing (best practices for proper station installation)

:::caution
It is imperative that you properly install your weather station. This will create the necessary conditions for quality weather data collection, which are required for the purpose of the WeatherXM network and the resulting rewards. Faulty installation, will result in less to none WXM rewards.

### Best practices for proper station installation

It is very important that your weather station collects quality measurements.
This turns the weather station into a powerful tool for yourself and WeatherXM.

The values of the various meteorological parameters measured by a weather station can significantly differ depending on the obstacles
and the material of the surfaces existing around the sensors. For this reason, there is a series of criteria that should be fulfilled:

### Pole's Height

<section class="explanation horizontal">
  <div class="copy">
    <p>
      The pole’s height, on which weather station will be mounted, should be at least 2 meters/6.5ft.
      This means that the weather station should be placed at least 2 meters/6.5ft above the ground and any other horizontal
      or almost horizontal surface (e.g., roof) above the station. The maximum acceptable pole height is 5 meters 16.4ft.

  </div>
</section>

### Tighten Pole

The pole should be adequately tightened in order to prevent any pole oscillations in cases of strong winds.
This will prevent the rain gauge spoon from faulty swinging and collecting faulty precipitation measurements.

<hr/>

### Installation Point

The pole together with the weather station should be placed in an installation point, which:

    <div class="copy">
      <h4>1. Away from heat sources</h4>
      <p>
        Is not affected by the air or smoke flowing out of any chimney or ventilation system
        (as an illustration, consider that wind of a certain direction may move warm smoke towards the station).
        An advisable distance from a heat source is >5 meters/16.4ft

      <h4>2. Does not get in shadowed areas</h4>
      <p>
        Is not shadowed by any obstacles during the day (consider that the sun typically is higher during summer and lower during winter affecting the shadow caused by an item)

      <h4>3. Adequate Distance</h4>
      <p>Has a distance from any obstacles around, which 2-4 times larger than the height of the highest obstacle
         (e.g., if the highest obstacle around the installation point is a 6-meter tree, ht=6m,
         and the pole of the outdoor sensor is 2 meters, hp=2m, then the pole should be placed at a distance (dp) of 8-16 meters,
         2 x (ht-hp) &#60; dp &#60; 4 x (ht-hp). In case the pole is placed on a building’s roof,
         then the building’s height should be added to the pole’s height).
         Note that in cases of obstacles with a height >8 meters, you should consider placing the outdoor sensor
         at a distance 30 times the width and 15 times the height of the obstacles around.

### Install the Mounting Pole

** Step 1: ** Fasten the plastic pole onto your fix pole with mounting base, clamp, washers, screws and nuts. Following below sequences:

- Insert the plastic pole into the hole of the mounting stand, and then secure it with the
screw and nut.

- Apply 2 rubber pads on the mounting clamp.

- Fasten the mounting stand and clamp together onto a fix pole with 4 long screws and nuts.


** Step 2: ** Apply 2 rubber pads on the inner sides of the mounting base and clamp of the weather station, and loosely fasten them together.

** Step 3: ** Place the weather station over the mounting pole and align it to North direction before fastening the screws.

:::caution
- Any metal object can attract lightning strikes, including the mounting pole. Never install weather station in stormy days.
- If you want to install a weather station on a house or building, consult a licensed electrical engineer to ensure proper grounding. Direct lightning impact on a metal pole can damage or destroy your home.
- Installing the sensor at high location may result in personal injury or death. Perform as many initial inspections and operations as possible on the ground and in buildings or houses. Only install the weather station on clear, dry days.
:::

<hr/>

### Direction Alignment

Install the weather station in an open location with no obstructions above and around the
sensor for accurate rain and wind measurement.
Locate the North (N) marker on top of the weather station and align the marker to point North
upon final installation with a compass or GPS. Tighten the mounting bracket around a 30 to
40 mm diameter pole (not included) using two screw and nuts provided.
Use the bubble level on the weather station to make sure the sensor is completely level for
proper measurement of rainfall, UV and light intensity.
