#### Reset your weather station and select device to pair

Push the reset button at the bottom of your WeatherXM device to enable bluetooth pairing. This will expire in 5 minutes. After that, you will need to push it again to restart the pairing process.
After that, push the "Pair station via bluetooth" button as seen in the picture below.

  <span>

#### Select the Location that you'll Install your Station

Allow access to your location so that the WeatherXM app knows where you are planning to install your WeatherXM station. Doing so will make it easier to complete this step.

Alternatively, you can find the location manually using the map.

Once you've found the right location, tap on the checkbox to acknowledge the correctness of the installation location and then tap on "Confirm and Proceed" button.

:::note
We do not track you, nor do we collect any data about your location.
:::

:::caution
Make sure you select the location that you will install your station as precisely as possible, as this will take part in the quality of the data you will share with the network and thus your overall WXM rewards.

### Set weather station operation frequency 


<section class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/select-freq.svg")} />
  <span>



For the weather station to operate properly, you need to set its frequency to match the Helium network frequency in your country.

[A list of the countries and their respective frequencies can be found here](https://docs.helium.com/lorawan-on-helium/frequency-plans/#frequency-plans-by-country).

Given the location of installation you defined in the previous step, we’ve selected the appropriate frequency for that location.

Once you've found the right frequency, tap on the checkbox to acknowledge the correctness of the installation and then tap on "Set & Claim" button.
That's it. You've now claimed your new WeatherXM station and you'll be able to see its data on your WeatherXM apps!

All you need to do now, is to update your weather station to the latest firmware version. To do so, please follow the instructions in the chapter ["Update Firmware"](/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/helium-update-firmware/). 

:::caution
The frequency selected above is the correct one the country you’ve installed and will operate this station.
