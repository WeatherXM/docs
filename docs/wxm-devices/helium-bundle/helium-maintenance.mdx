The maintenance of the weather station is an important process, which should be conducted meticulously over the suggested period of time.
This process includes the cleaning of certain parts of the outdoor unit and the replacement of batteries.

The maintenance process is summarised in the following steps.

### Rain Gauge
Clean the rain gauge at least once every 3 months.
Rotate the funnel counter-clockwise and lift to expose the rain gauge mechanism
and clean with a damp cloth. Remove any dirt, debris and insects.
If bug infestation is an issue, spray the array lightly with insecticide.
It is important not to swing the rain gauge spoon during this process,
as the weather station will measure and record faulty precipitation.
The sketch below shows how to open the rain gauge.

### Solar Panel
Clean the solar panel at least every 3 months with a damp cloth.

### Thermo-Hygro Sensor
Remove any dirt, debris and insects from the [thermo-hygro sensor](/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/helium-contents#weather-station) every 12 months. It may be needed to open the radiation shield using a screwdriver and fully clean the thermo-hygro sensor in case there is too much debris on it.

:::note
You should occasionally check the battery level of the weather station via the settings menu on the mobile app. If the battery level is low, you should replace the batteries.
In harsh environments, inspect the batteries every 3 months (e.g. when cleaning the solar panel).
