Setting up the weather station is a process of several steps in order to make this system work properly
and measure weather conditions as accurately as possible.

## Prerequisites for proper assembly

1. Screwdriver (not included)
2. Metal wrench (not included)
3. Batteries  1.5V **not rechargeable** (x6 AA) (not included)

:::danger 
If you use rechargeable batteries, you may harm your device.
:::

:::caution
In order to properly deploy the weather station, you will need six (x6) AA batteries. These are not included in the box.
:::

## Step by step instructions

### Battery installation diagram (external box)

  </div>

  - **Step 1:** Slide the battery box lock switch to unlock position. Push to open the battery box door according to the arrow direction.

  - **Step 2:** Insert the 6 AA batteries according to the +/- polarity indicated.

  - **Step 3:**  Place and lock the battery box door.

</div>

  - **Step 4:**  Unscrew the battery door at the bottom of the weather station.

  - **Step 5:**  Insert the dummy battery to the battery compartment, make sure the  +/- polarity is correct.

  - **Step 6:**  Replace the battery door which comes along with the external battery box, then tighten the battery door screw.


:::caution
If the dummy battery is not installed in the correct orientation, no power will be provided and the LED indicator will not be flashing.
:::

:::danger
**Rechargeable batteries should not be used**, as they provide lower voltages and lose power over time.
Solar panel is not trying to charge the batteries, but only provides power to an internal super capacitor,
thus no point using rechargeable ones.
:::

:::danger
Batteries should not be installed backwards. This may permanently damage the weather station.
:::

Although alkaline batteries are sufficient for most climates, lithium non-rechargeable batteries could be used for cold weather climates.

The primary power source for the weather station is the solar panel. When solar power is available (sun light) a super capacitor is charged
and is later used during night and when there is insufficient solar light.
In climates that frequently sustain temperatures below 0°C or 32°F the use of lithium batteries is recommended
as these are performing better than alkaline batteries under such circumstances, but depend on battery manufacturer and quality.

:::note Note 2
In case that LED is permanently on or does not light up at all,
make sure that the batteries are inserted fully and in the correct way.

### LED of sensor working status

At the bottom of the weather station there are buttons and indicators:

<div class="explanation">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/button-indicators.svg")} />

  Once the batteries are inserted, the LED indicator on the back of the station should turn on for 4 seconds
  and then flash every 16 seconds indicating that the station transmits the data.

### Adjust the solar panel

The tilting angle of the solar panel can be adjusted vertically from 0° into 15°, 30°, 45° and 60° positions depending on the area you are living in. For optimal power output year-round,
please set the tilt angle that is closest to your latitude.

<details class="accordion">

<summary>Set tilt angle of solar panel related to your location</summary>

| Location ( latitude, longitude)  | Solar panel tilt angle    |
| -----------------------           | ------------------------  |
| Hamburg (53.558, 9.7874)          | 60°                       |
| Chicago (42.1146, -88.0464)       | 45°                       |
| Houston (29.7711, -95.3552)       | 30°                       |
| Bangkok (14.2752, 100.5684)       | 15°                       |
| Sydney (-33.5738, 151.3053) *     | 0°                       |

***Sensors installed in southern hemisphere must have their solar panels flat to ensure maximum solar efficiency.**

:::danger
If the screw holding the solar panel is not released for the adjustment, there is a risk of breaking the plastic enclosure.
:::
:::caution
Do not remove solar panel protection film before assemble battery box properly.
:::

- **Step 1:** Remove the solar panel protection film.

- **Step 2:** Loosen the screw lightly until the gears on the opposite side separated from lock position.

- **Step 3:** Adjust the vertical angle of the solar panel (0°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°) according to the latitude of your location.

- **Step 4:** Push the gear and tighten the screw until the gears are securely locked.
