The process is done wirelessly via bluetooth and requires you to be at a distance of ~<10m from the station.

This document describes the firmware update process using an Android smartphone, the process for iOS is similar.

Push the reset button at the bottom of your WeatherXM device to enable bluetooth pairing.This will expire in 5 minutes.After that, you will need to push it again to restart the pairing process.

:::note
by pairing your devices WeatherXM app will be able to communicate and exchange all necessary data to continue pairing.
