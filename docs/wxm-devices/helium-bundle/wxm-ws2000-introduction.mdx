You just got your station, or, you will soon!

### Connect and claim station

Once you've finished with installation, you can connect your station to the Helium network and claim it as your own in WeatherXM network. To do this, **you will need to download our WeatherXM app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weatherxm.app&hl=en&gl=US" target="blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/weatherxm/id1629841929" target="blank">iOS</a>).**

### Install your weather station

This is one of the most important steps, as proper installation is key in order to collect valid weather data. For this step, **you will need a pole that is at least 2m/6.5ft and a way to secure it in place (both not included in the box).** Here you will also see the best practices on how to properly install the station according to WMO.

### Add your ERC20 compatible wallet

In order to receive WXM rewards, you will need to connect an ERC20 compatible wallet which supports Arbitrum Sepolia Testnet. We have prepared a guide to do so using MetaMask (although it is not mandatory to use this).
