If the process hangs and does not proceed or if pairing fails, try a factory reset.
To factory reset, hold down the middle button on the bottom of the weather station, count to ~10 and release. The LED will start flashing very quickly as an indication that the factory reset has succeeded and then the station will restart.

Restart your station pairing is only allowed in the first 5 minutes after the station is started. After 5 minutes the station refuses pairing. If the problem persists do a factory reset and try again.

Make sure the device has started. Remove and reinsert one of the batteries. The light at the bottom of the station will flash a few times. If problem persists, move at least within 10m/30ft from the station.
