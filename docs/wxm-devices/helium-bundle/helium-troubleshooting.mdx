### The app cannot connect to the station after successfully pairing

<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/connection-failed.svg")} />
  <span>
    If the claiming process is repeated more than twice without completion, attempt to unpair your weather station and start over. If you encounter connection problems during the claiming, make sure that you are near to the weather station at all times. The solution to the above is to visit the Bluetooth settings of the mobile phone, find the station in the paired devices and "forget the device". This flow is different on Android and iOS.
