:::info
**if you experience connection issues while claiming a helium device,  make sure you are near the station.**

### The updating process lasts forever

<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/reset_station.svg")} />
  <span>

If the process hangs and does not proceed or if pairing fails, try a factory reset.
To factory reset, hold down the middle button on the bottom of the weather station, count to ~10 and release. The LED will start flashing very quickly as an indication that the factory reset has succeeded and then the station will restart.

### Asks to pair but fails

<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/fail-pairing.svg")} />
<span>

Restart your station. Pairing is only allowed in the first 5 minutes after the station is started. After 5 minutes the station refuses pairing. If the problem persists, do a factory reset and try again. 

:::note
The Helium station is reset to factory settings by pressing and holding the reset button for ~5 seconds. When released, a pulsating red indicator should be displayed to the right of it. This indicates a successful reset to the factory settings of the helium station.

### No location (GPS) data

<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/helium-clear-sky-view.png")} />
<span>

If your station reports "No location data" please make sure your station is installed properly as per the installation instructions. 

:::note
Your station reports its location a few times per day depending on network and battery status and thus it might take some time until the location is confirmed by the WeatherXM platform.

<hr/>

### Location not verified
You receive a "location not verified" error on your mobile app when the [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location) flags your weather station because the location reported by its **GPS receiver(s)** is different than the location you declared during the setup and claiming of the station. This happens because either you moved the station from its initial installation site, or you declared a wrong location during the onboarding of the station on your mobile app.

This incurs a "relocation penalty" (as mentioned in [the whitepaper](http://weatherxm.com/whitepaper)) meaning your station will be exempt from reward distribution until the weather station is moved back to the declared location or the location is updated by using the "relocate station" function on your mobile app. After the passing of **7 days** from fixing your location, the relocation penalty will be lifted and your station will start generating rewards as usual.

:::caution
The "relocate station" function is **not yet available** as Proof of Location is running in **test-mode** on the beta testnet. This means that even if PoL flags your station for location errors **your rewards will NOT be affected** until the "relocate function" is available for use. Users will be given enough time to update the location of their stations to the actual location before the Reward Mechanism will actually start applying relocation penalties to the stations that are reporting wrong locations.

### My station is not detected during scanning

<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/no-device-found.svg")} />
  <span>

Make sure the device has started.  Press the reset button at the bottom of the weather station. The light at the bottom of the station will flash a few times. the light at the bottom of the station will flash a few times indicating that the restart was successful. 
If it continues to go undetected, try scanning again from a closer distance. The operating bluetooth range of the station is around 10m/32ft with few obstacles.

### The process does not start or is stopped before it is completed

<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/scanning-failed.svg")} />
  <span>

Close the application and start the process again. If the problem persists, press the reset button at the bottom of the weather station and try again. Finally, try doing a factory reset.
</span>
</div>

### The app cannot connect to the station after successfully pairing

<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/connection-failed.svg")} />
  <span>
    If the claiming process is repeated more than twice without completion, attempt to unpair your weather station and start over. If you encounter connection problems during the claiming, make sure that you are near to the weather station at all times. The solution to the above is to visit the Bluetooth settings of the mobile phone, find the station in the paired devices and "forget the device". This flow is different on Android and iOS.
