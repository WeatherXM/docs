### The updating process lasts forever

If the process hangs and does not proceed or if pairing fails, try a factory reset.
To factory reset, hold down the middle button on the bottom of the weather station, count to ~10 and release. The LED will start flashing very quickly as an indication that the factory reset has succeeded and then the station will restart.

### Asks to pair but fails

Restart your station. Pairing is only allowed in the first 5 minutes after the station is started. After 5 minutes the station refuses pairing. If the problem persists do a factory reset and try again.

Make sure the device has started. Remove and reinsert one of the batteries. The light at the bottom of the station will flash a few times. If problem persists, move at least within 10m/30ft from the station.

### The process does not start or is stopped before it is completed

Close the application and start the process again. If the problem persists, press the RESET button on the station to restart (or remove and replace one of the batteries) and try again. Finally, try doing a factory reset.
