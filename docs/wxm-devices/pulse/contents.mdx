## Main Parts

### Outdoor Weather Station

The outdoor sensor is a set of sensors encased in a plastic shell that ensures the proper function of the weather station.

The outdoor sensor is responsible for:

1. the collection of measurements of local temperature, humidity, rain, wind speed and wind direction, and
1. the wireless transmission of the data to the weather miner.

</div>
The WG3000 Gateway is the device responsible for receiving weather measurements from the outdoor sensor and transmitting them via cellular connection  to the WeatherXM network.

The WG3000 Gateway is advised to be placed outdoors, ideally on a the same pole as the Weather Station, to ensure the best possible connection to the cellular network and with the Weather Station.
