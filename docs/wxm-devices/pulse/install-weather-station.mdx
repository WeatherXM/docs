## Mounting the outdoor sensor

<div class="explanation">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/ws1000/pole-assembly.svg")} />
    <p>If this is the first time that you set up this outdoor sensor,
    then you should make sure that all parts work properly before mounting the sensor on the pole outdoors.<br />
    When you are about to fasten the pole on which you have tightened the outdoor sensor, look at the bubble level.
    After fastening the pole, the bubble should be fully inside the red circle.<br />
    If it is not, wind direction, speed, and rain readings may not operate correctly or accurately.<br />
    Adjust the mounting pole as necessary. If the bubble is close, but not quite inside the circle
    and you cannot adjust the mounting pole, you may try small wooden or heavy cardboard shims between the outdoor sensor
    and the top of the mounting pole to achieve the desired result (this will require loosening the bolts and some experimentation).<br />
    Now, you may tighten the bolts with a wrench.</p>
