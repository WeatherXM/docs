## Best Practices for Proper Station Installation

It is very important that your weather station collects quality measurements.
This turns the weather station into a powerful tool for yourself and WeatherXM.

The values of the various meteorological parameters measured by a weather station can significantly differ depending on the obstacles
and the material of the surfaces existing around the sensors. For this reason, there is a series of criteria that should be fulfilled:

### Pole's Height
The pole’s height, on which the weather station will be mounted, should be at least 2m/6.5ft.
This means that the weather station should be placed at least 2m/6.5ft above the ground and any other horizontal
or almost horizontal surface (e.g., roof) above the station. The maximum acceptable pole height is 5m/16.5ft.

### Tighten Pole
The pole should be adequately tightened in order to prevent any pole oscillations in cases of strong winds.
This will prevent the rain gauge spoon from swinging and collecting faulty precipitation measurements.

### Installation Point

The pole together with the weather station should be placed in an installation point, which:

<h4>1. Is away from heat sources</h4>
Is not affected by the air or smoke flowing out of any chimney or ventilation system
(as an illustration, consider that wind of a certain direction may move warm smoke towards the station).
An advisable distance from a heat source is >5 meters/16.4ft.

</section>

<h4>2. Does not get in shadowed areas</h4>
Is not shadowed by any obstacle during the day (consider that the sun is typically higher during summer and lower during winter affecting the shadow caused by an item).

  </div>
</section>

<h4>3. Adequate Distance</h4>
Has a distance from any obstacles around, which 2-4 times larger than the height of the highest obstacle
(e.g., if the highest obstacle around the installation point is a 6m/20ft tree, ht=6m/20ft,
and the pole of the outdoor sensor is 2m/6.5ft, hp=2m/6.5ft, then the pole should be placed at a distance (dp) of 8-16m/26-52.5ft,
2 x (ht-hp) &#60; dp &#60; 4 x (ht-hp). In case the pole is placed on a building’s roof,
then the building’s height should be added to the pole’s height).
Note that in cases of obstacles with a height >8m/26ft, you should consider placing the outdoor sensor
at a distance 30 times the width and 15 times the height of the obstacles around.

while 3. is important for avoiding faulty precipitation and wind measurements.
