## Main Parts

### Outdoor Weather Station

The outdoor sensor is a set of sensors encased in a plastic shell that ensures the proper function of the weather station.

The outdoor sensor is responsible for:

1. the collection of measurements of local temperature, humidity, rain, wind speed and wind direction, and
1. the wireless transmission of the data to the weather miner.

  <div>
    <p>
      The WG1200 Gateway (D1 WiFi) is the device responsible for receiving weather measurements from the outdoor sensor and transmitting them via WiFi to IPFS and the WeatherXM network.
      The D1 Gateway is advised to be placed indoors, in an environment of relatively constant temperature (ideally within a daily range of &#60;4°C/7°F for proper functioning of the barometer).
     The D1 Gateway should be permanently connected to power and powered on in order to be able to receive, record and upload measurements to the Internet.
