## WG1200 Gateway (D1 WiFi)

<img object-fit="contain" src={useBaseUrl("/img/home/wg1200-gateway.png")} />

The weather station comes together with the D1 Gateway.
The D1 Gateway receives all the meteorological data plus the location of the weather station, which are measured and transmitted every 16 seconds by the outdoor sensor
and displays them on its screen.


In this chapter, you will find guidance to set up the D1 Gateway.
<hr/>

## Prerequisites

1. The station must be fully assembled (parts and batteries).
1. A working smartphone with connection to the internet.
3. A reliable 2.4 GHz WiFi network (**5 GHz is not supported**) for the WG1200 Gateway (D1 WiFi) to connect to.

<hr/>



## Step by Step Instructions



### Connect D1 Gateway to power source and turn device on


  
- The D1 Gateway must be connected to a power source at all times.


:::caution
If D1 Gateway turns off, you will not receive $WXM rewards, as you will not be able to share data with the WeatherXM network. **This will result in no $WXM rewards!**
D1 does not have a battery, so it must be connected to a power source at all times.
:::


<hr/>




### Change Frequency (Optional)


The D1 Gateway's frequency must be set to match the frequency of your weather station so it can listen for the weather data it transmits. There are 2 frequencies available:
- Model A: 868 MHz (default)
- Model B: 915 MHz

:::note
**If your weather station is 868 MHz, you don't need to change anything as it is configured to this value by default.**
If unsure, check the sticker under the station or the box that came in it.

By now, your D1 Gateway is set and ready for claiming!
Swipe left to navigate to the settings screen. There, tap on "Configure WiFi" to switch to connect mode.

Once this is done, connect to D1 Gateway via WiFi (you should see in the networks screen a "WXM_WG1200").

A popup will open, asking you to select the desired network you'd like to connect the D1 Gateway. Select the one you want and provide the password for it.

In case of a successful connection, and the popup does't open, navigate with your browser to 10.10.0.1 and follow the instructions displayed. 

:::note
Once the WiFi credentials have been successfully transferred to D1 Gateway, the device will reboot and the WiFi icon will turn green!

### Confirm station installation Location & Claim your Device

<img

  style={{ width: '200px', height: 'auto', objectFit: 'contain' }} 
/>


#### Select the Location that you'll Install your Station

Allow access to your location so that the WeatherXM app knows where you are planning to install your weather station. Doing so will make it easier to complete this step.

Alternatively, you can find the location manually using the map.

Once you've found the right location, tap on the checkbox to confirm and then tap on "Claim" button.

All you need to do now, is to add your compatible wallet so you can receive WXM rewards. To do so, please follow the instructions in the chapter  ["Add/edit wallet address"](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address#how-to-create-wallet-on-metamask). 

<img 
  src={useBaseUrl("/img/wxm-devices/D1-bundle/D1-successful-claim.png")} 
  style={{ width: '200px', height: 'auto', objectFit: 'contain' }} 
/>

 
That's it! You've now claimed your new weather station and you'll be able to see its data on your WeatherXM app!


:::note
We do not track you, nor do we collect any data about your location.
:::

:::caution
Make sure you define the location that you will install your station as precisely as possible, as this is important for the quality of data you will share with the network and thus your overall WXM rewards.
:::

:::caution
Your first rewards will appear after 24 hours of the station being online.
:::  



:::info 
Usually, it takes up to 30 minutes for the station to appear on the [explorer](https://explorer.weatherxm.com/stats)
