## WG1200 Gateway

<img object-fit="contain" src={useBaseUrl("/img/home/WG1200-gateway-side.png")} style={{ width: '50%', height: 'auto' }}/>

The weather station comes together with the WG1200 Gateway.
The WG1200 Gateway receives all the meteorological data plus the location of the weather station, which are measured and transmitted every 16 seconds by the outdoor sensor
and displays them on its screen.

In this chapter, you will find guidance to set up the WG1200 Gateway.
<hr/>

## Prerequisites

1. The station must be fully assembled (parts and batteries).
1. A working smartphone with connection to the internet.
1. A reliable 2.4 GHz WiFi network (**5 GHz is not supported**) for the WG1200 Gateway to connect to.
1. The [WeatherXM](/wxm-devices/D1-bundle/D1-connect-and-claim#download-weatherxm-app-and-login) Application installed on your smartphone.

<hr/>

## Step by Step Instructions

### Connect WG1200 Gateway to power source and turn the gateway on
 
The WG1200 Gateway must be connected to a power source at all times.

:::caution
If WG1200 Gateway turns off, you will not receive \$WXM rewards, as you will not be able to share data with the WeatherXM network. **This will result in no $WXM rewards!**
WG1200 does not have a battery, so it must be connected to a power source at all times.

### Change Frequency (Optional)

<div class="explanation">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/wxm-devices/D1-bundle/D1-set_freq.png")} />
  <span>
The WG1200 Gateway's frequency must be set to match the frequency of your weather station so it can listen for the weather data it transmits. There are 2 frequencies available:
- Model A: 868 MHz (default)
- Model B: 915 MHz

:::note
**If your weather station is 868 MHz, you don't need to change anything as it is configured to this value by default.**
If unsure, check the sticker under the station or the box that came in it.
:::
  </span>
</div>

### Steps to change the frequency
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <img class="control" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/D1-bundle/Image_1_Swipe-right.png")} style={{ width: '24%', height: 'auto' }} />
  <img class="control" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/D1-bundle/Image_2_select_freq.png")} style={{ width: '24%', height: 'auto' }} />
  <img class="control" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/D1-bundle/Image_3_set_freq.png")} style={{ width: '24%', height: 'auto' }} />
  <img class="control" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/D1-bundle/Set_Frequency.png")} style={{ width: '24%', height: 'auto'  }} />
</div>
<br></br>
1. Swipe right on the touch screen.
1. Click the Frequency options and select the new frequency your WG1200 Gateway will listen to.
1. A confirmation dialog will open. Read it carefully and click "Continue" or "Cancel" accordingly.
1. Finally, your WG1200 Gateway will restart after setting the frequency to the selected one.

:::caution
If you don't use the correct frequency as your weather station, WG1200 Gateway will not be able to communicate with your weather station, thus you will not send any weather data and receive any $WXM rewards!

### Confirm station installation Location & Claim your Device

<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/D1-bundle/D1-Location.png")} />
  <span>

#### Select the Location that you'll Install your Station

Allow access to your location so that the WeatherXM app knows where you are planning to install your weather station. Doing so will make it easier to complete this step.

Alternatively, you can find the location manually using the map.

Once you've found the right location, tap on the checkbox to confirm and then tap on "Claim" button.

All you need to do now, is to add your compatible wallet so you can receive WXM rewards. To do so, please follow the instructions in the chapter  ["Add/edit wallet address"](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address#how-to-create-wallet-on-metamask).

That's it! You've now claimed your new weather station and you'll be able to see its data on your WeatherXM app!

:::note
We do not track you, nor do we collect any data about your location.
:::

:::caution
Make sure you define the location that you will install your station as precisely as possible, as this is important for the quality of data you will share with the network and thus your overall WXM rewards.
:::

:::caution
Your first rewards will appear after 24 hours of the station being online.
