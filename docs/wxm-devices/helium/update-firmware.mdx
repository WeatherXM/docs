In order for your station to keep operating normally and receive WXM rewards, you must update the station.

The process is done wirelessly via bluetooth and requires you to be at a distance of ~{'<'}10m/32ft from the station.

This document describes the firmware update process using an Android smartphone, the process for iOS is similar.

Push the reset button at the bottom of your WeatherXM device to enable bluetooth pairing.This will expire in 5 minutes. After that, you will need to push it again to restart the pairing process.

:::note
Your mobile phone must be paired to your weather station for the mobile app to be able to communicate with it. This procedure needs to take place only once. All further communications do not require any pairing as your weather station stays paired to your mobile phone as long as it was not factory reset or the pairing manually removed in your phone.

:::caution
Make sure you don't move away from your station as you might lose bluetooth connection.
