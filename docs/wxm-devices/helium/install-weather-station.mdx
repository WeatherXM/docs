## Prerequisites for proper installation
1. Pole of at least 2m/6.5ft (not included)
1. Base or bolts to secure in place (not included)
1. Location and spacing [Best Practices for Proper Station Installation](/wxm-devices/helium/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation)

:::caution
It is imperative that you properly install your weather station. This will create the necessary conditions for quality weather data collection, which are required for the purpose of the WeatherXM network and the resulting rewards. Faulty installation, will result in less to none WXM rewards.

## Best Practices for Proper Station Installation

It is very important that your weather station collects quality measurements.
This turns the weather station into a powerful tool for yourself and WeatherXM.

The values of the various meteorological parameters measured by a weather station can significantly differ depending on the obstacles
and the material of the surfaces existing around the sensors. For this reason, there is a series of criteria that should be fulfilled:

Don't sure for your installation point? Check deployment examples [here](/wxm-devices/deployment-examples).
:::

### Pole's Height
The pole’s height, on which the weather station will be mounted, should be at least 2m/6.5ft.
This means that the weather station should be placed at least 2m/6.5ft above the ground and any other horizontal
or almost horizontal surface (e.g., roof) above the station. The maximum acceptable pole height is 5m/16.5ft.

</div>

### Tighten Pole
The pole should be adequately tightened in order to prevent any pole oscillations in cases of strong winds.
This will prevent the rain gauge spoon from swinging and collecting faulty precipitation measurements.

### Installation Point

The pole together with the weather station should be placed in an installation point, which:

<h4>1. Is away from heat sources</h4>
Is not affected by the air or smoke flowing out of any chimney or ventilation system
(as an illustration, consider that wind of a certain direction may move warm smoke towards the station).
An advisable distance from a heat source is >5 meters/16.4ft.

</section>

<h4>2. Does not get in shadowed areas</h4>
Is not shadowed by any obstacle during the day (consider that the sun is typically higher during summer and lower during winter affecting the shadow caused by an item).

    <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/ws1000/shadow-soft.svg")} />
  </div>
</section>

<h4>3. Adequate Distance</h4>
Has a distance from any obstacle around, which 2-4 times larger than the height of the highest obstacle
(e.g., if the highest obstacle around the installation point is a 6m/20ft tree, ht=6m/20ft,
and the pole of the weather station is 2m/6.56ft, hp=2m/6.56ft, then the pole should be placed at a distance (dp) of 8-16m/26-52ft,
2 x (ht-hp) &#60; dp &#60; 4 x (ht-hp). In case the pole is placed on a building’s roof,
then the building’s height should be added to the pole’s height).
Note that in cases of obstacles with a height >8m/26ft, you should consider placing the weather station
at a distance 30 times the width and 15 times the height of the obstacles around.

:::note
All of 1, 2 and 3 are important tips for measuring temperature and humidity as accurate as possible
while 3. is important for avoiding faulty precipitation and wind measurements.

### Direction Alignment

<div class="explanation">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/wxm-devices/helium/direction-alignment.svg")} />
    <p>
    Install the weather station in an open location with no obstructions above and around the
    sensor for accurate rain and wind measurement.
    Locate the North (N) marker on top of the weather station and align the marker to point North
    upon final installation with a compass or GPS. Tighten the mounting bracket around a 30-60mm 
    or 1.1-2.36in diameter pole (not included) using the two screws and nuts provided.
    Use the bubble level on the weather station to make sure the sensor is completely level for
    proper measurement of precipitation, wind direction, UV and light intensity.
