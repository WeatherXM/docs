## Weather Sensors

### Outdoor sensor not reporting data to WXM-M5 data miner. There are dashes (--) on the display console.

First make sure you M5 frequency matches your weather station (see [Change frequency](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-connect-and-claim#change-frequency))

Check the transmitter LED on the outdoor sensor (see [Reset Button and LED Indicator](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/assemble-m5#outdoor-weather-station) for flashing.
The LED should flash every 16 seconds.

If the LED is not flashing every 16 seconds, replace the batteries in the outdoor sensor.
If the batteries were recently replaced, check the polarity.

If the above does not solve the issue, there may be a temporary loss of communication due to reception loss related to interference or other location factors, or the WXM-M5 has not been reset.
The solution may be as simple as powering down and up the WXM-M5. Make sure you use lithium non-rechargeable batteries, especially in case of cold weather environments.

1. With the outdoor sensor array and WXM-M5 10 feet (3 meters) away from each other,
   remove the batteries from the outdoor sensor and wait 10 seconds. Put the batteries back in.
1. WXM-M5 should display all the observations measured by the outdoor sensor.
1. Try to place the WXM-M5 at the desirable point and check that it receives data.
   Ensure the power adapter (if used) is not too close to the WXM-M5, and the WXM-M5 is not close to other electrical noise generating devices
   such as TVs, monitors, computers and transmitting devices.
1. If you still have intermittent problems, move the outdoor sensor and the WXM-M5 closer together,
   but not closer than 5 ft (1.5m) or further than 50m (100m) if you use the internal (external) LoRa antenna.
   Also check that there are no metal barriers like aluminum siding,
   or metal wall framing, along the line of sight between the outdoor sensor and WXM-M5.
   Relocate the sensor and console as necessary to avoid obstacles.
   Depending on natural barriers you may also have to move the outdoor sensor higher and/or closer.
1. Use the external RF antenna provided with M5, but this requires you open the M5 (see [Switch external/internal Radio Function (RF) - LoRa antenna](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-connect-and-claim#switch-externalinternal-radio-function-rf---lora-antenna)).

### Temperature looks higher than expected.

If the temperature is slightly higher (e.g., +2-5°C) than expected,
then assure that the outdoor sensor is within a significant distance from heat sources
like ventilation systems and active chimneys.
Make also sure that the outdoor sensor is mounted on a 2 (or more) meter metallic pole and there are no obstacles close by (see [Best Practices for Proper Station Installation](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation)).

### Other variables, such as wind direction, wind speed, rain height and humidity do not align with an official weather reporting station

Even weather stations, which are close to each other, may obtain slightly different measurements,
especially for the variables of wind speed and wind direction. However, you should not expect significant deviations
e.g., from a weather station, which is located within a distance of 1km.
If there are deviations, please check [Best Practices for Proper Station Installation](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation) for guidelines about the installation of the outdoor sensor.

### One or more variables are extremely high, low, or constant for long periods of time.

Change the batteries of the outdoor sensor. Make sure you use lithium non-rechargeable batteries, especially in case of cold weather environments.

## Wi-Fi Connectivity

### No Wi-Fi connection

Check for the Wi-Fi symbol on the top-right corner of the display.

- If wireless connectivity is operational, the Wi-Fi icon will appear in green.
- If the symbol appears in red, but you do remember configuring it successfully before, check that the WXM-M5 and internet router are close enough.

If you have never been able to configure Wi-Fi to a working state, make sure your Wi-Fi supports 2.4 GHz signals. The console does not support Wi-Fi that uses the 5 GHz spectrum.

Make sure you configured the correct SSID and password. Repeat the procedure if necessary to verify.

## GPS Signal

### No GPS signal (no values of latitude, longitude, and altitude)

1. Move your WXM-M5 outdoors (with the GPS antenna connected, if you use the external one)
   for a couple of minutes till “lon”, “lat” and “alt” values appear.
1. Then, move WXM-M5 indoors placing the GPS antenna next to a window.

If the problem remains and you use the internal GPS antenna, switch to the external antenna (see [Switch external/internal GPS antenna](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-connect-and-claim#switch-externalinternal-gps-antenna)).


## My Station does not connect to the M5

  <span>

If the installation of the station and the placement of the M5 miner is more than 50 meters / 164 feet apart, you must install the LoRa antenna so that the two can communicate over such distance.
Please follow the instructions below, or in the video.

[![Instruction on how to switch to LoRa antenna](/img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/video-LoRaWan.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP4rT3FTz0M&)

</section>

:::caution
If the station and M5 are more than 50 meters / 164 feet apart, you must install the LoRa antenna. Else the station might not be able to properly communicate with M5, resulting in less to none data being shared to the network, and thus reduce WXM rewards.

<summary>M5 LoRa Antenna Installation Instructions</summary>


#### M5 Antenna Troubleshooting

WXM-M5 is equipped with two antennas, the GPS and the LoRa. The GPS antenna is used to determine the location (coordinates) and altitude of the weather station,
while the LoRa antenna is responsible for the communication between the WXM-M5 and the outdoor sensor.

On the left side of the WXM-M5 you may notice that there are two different slices, a gray for GPS and a blue for LoRa.
Each of these slices contains a system relevant to the antennas mentioned above.

By default, the external GPS antenna and the internal RF/LoRa antenna are connected, and there is no need to modify this.

The antenna plugs are VERY SENSITIVE so it is NOT recommended to switch cables unless there is a serious problem.

#### Switch external/internal GPS antenna

The WXM-M5 beta v1 uses by default the external GPS antenna, which should be connected to the port on the gray GPS slice
In case you desire to change the internal/external GPS antenna, follow the following steps:

1. Unscrew and remove the four screws behind the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the first cap. You may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the cap from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. You will notice two small cables, one coming from the port on the side and one coming from a small chip.
   Remove the cable, which is connected to a specific reception on the green board and connect the desired cable to the same reception.
1. Clasp the cap back and screw the device.
1. In case you changed to external GPS antenna, connect the external antenna to the corresponding port on the side of the WXM-M5.

#### Switch external/internal Radio Function (RF) - LoRa antenna

The WXM-M5 beta v1 uses by default the internal LoRa antenna.
In case you desire to change the internal/external LoRa antenna, follow the following steps:

1. Unscrew and remove the four screws behind the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the first cap. You may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the cap from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the gray GPS slice. Again you may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the slice from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. You will notice two small cables, one coming from the port on the side and one coming from an edge of the green board.
   Remove the cable, which is connected to a specific reception on the green board and
   connect the desired cable to the same reception.
1. Clasp the slices and the cap back and screw the device.
1. In case you changed to external LoRa antenna, connect the external antenna to the corresponding port on the side of the WXM-M5.

##### Internal parts of the WXM-M5

- (a) Bottom is the first cap you remove once the WXM-M5 is unscrewed.
- (b) The gray GPS is the second slice
- (c) the blue RF LoRa is the third slice
- (d) The TOP is the rest of WXM-M5 device.
