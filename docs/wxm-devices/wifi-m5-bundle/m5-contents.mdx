## Main Parts

### Outdoor Weather Station

The outdoor sensor is a set of sensors encased in a plastic shell that ensures the proper function of the weather station.

The outdoor sensor is responsible for:

1. the collection of measurements of local temperature, humidity, rain, wind speed and wind direction, and
1. the wireless transmission of the data to the weather miner.

This part of your weather station is placed outdoors.
For further details about an advisable installation of the outdoor sensor, please see [Installing the WXM-WS1000 Weather Station](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station).

The following figures show a sketch of the outdoor sensor. The sketch comes with a description of all the important parts and sensors of it.


### M5 Miner

<div class="control">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-contents.svg")} />
  <div>
    <p>
      The M5 Miner is the device responsible for receiving weather measurements from the outdoor sensor and transmitting them via WiFi to IPFS and the WeatherXM network.
      The M5 Miner is advised to be placed indoors, in an environment of relatively constant temperature (ideally within a daily range of &#60;4°C/7°F for proper functioning of the barometer),
      near a window (for better GPS signal). The M5 Miner should be permanently connected to power and powered on in order to be able to receive, record and upload measurements to the Internet.
      The following graph shows the location of the buttons and the needed connections. Briefly, there is a power and a reset button, a  port for the GPS antenna and a USB Type-C port for power supply.
