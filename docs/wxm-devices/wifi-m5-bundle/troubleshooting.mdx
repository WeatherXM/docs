# Troubleshooting

## Weather Sensors

### Outdoor sensor not reporting to WXM-M5 data miner. There are dashes (--) on the display console.

Check the transmitter LED on the outdoor sensor (see [Fig. 4] and [Reset Button and Transmitter LED](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#reset-button-and-transmitter-led) for flashing.
The LED should flash every 16 seconds.

If the LED is not flashing every 16 seconds, replace the batteries in the outdoor sensor.
If the batteries were recently replaced, check the polarity.

If the above does not solve the issue, there may be a temporary loss of communication due to reception loss related to interference or other location factors, or the WXM-M5 has not been reset.
The solution may be as simple as powering down and up the WXM-M5. Make sure you use lithium non-rechargeable batteries, especially in case of cold weather environments.

1. With the outdoor sensor array and WXM-M5 10 feet (3 meters) away from each other,
   remove the batteries from the outdoor sensor and wait 10 seconds. Put the batteries back in.
1. WXM-M5 should display all the observations measured by the outdoor sensor.
1. Try to place the WXM-M5 at the desirable point and check that it receives data.
   Ensure the power adapter (if used) is not too close to the WXM-M5, and the WXM-M5 is not close to other electrical noise generating devices
   such as TVs, monitors, computers and transmitting devices.
1. If you still have intermittent problems, move the outdoor sensor and the WXM-M5 closer together,
   but not closer than 5 ft (1.5m) or further than 50m (100m) if you use the internal (external) LoRa antenna.
   Also check that there are no metal barriers like aluminum siding,
   or metal wall framing, along the line of sight between the outdoor sensor and WXM-M5.
   Relocate the sensor and console as necessary to avoid obstacles.
   Depending on natural barriers you may also have to move the outdoor sensor higher and/or closer.
1. Use the external RF antenna provided with M5, but this requires you open the M5 (see [Switch external/internal Radio Function (RF) - LoRa antenna](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5##switch-externalinternal-radio-function-rf---lora-antenna)).

### Temperature looks higher than expected.

If the temperature is slightly higher (e.g., +2-5°C) than expected,
then assure that the outdoor sensor is within a significant distance from heat sources
like ventilation systems and active chimneys.
Make also sure that the outdoor sensor is mounted on a 2 (or more) meter metallic pole and there are no obstacles close by (see [Good practice guides for placing the outdoor sensor](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#good-practice-guides-for-placing-the-outdoor-sensor)).

### Other variables, such as wind direction, wind speed, rain height and humidity does not agree with official reporting station

Even weather stations, which are close to each other, may obtain slightly different measurements,
especially for the variables of wind speed and wind direction. However, you should not expect significant deviations
e.g., from a weather station, which is located within a distance of 1km.
If there are deviations, please check [Good practice guides for placing the outdoor sensor](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#good-practice-guides-for-placing-the-outdoor-sensor) for guidelines about the installation of the outdoor sensor.

### One or more variables are extremely high, low or constant for long periods of time.

Change the batteries of the outdoor sensor. Make sure you use lithium non-rechargeable batteries, especially in case of cold weather environments.

## Wi-Fi Connectivity

### No Wi-Fi connection

Check for the Wi-Fi symbol on the right corner of the display.

- If wireless connectivity is operational, the Wi-Fi icon will appear in green color.
- If the symbol appears in red, but you do remember configuring it successfully before, check that the WXM-M5 and internet router are close enough.

If you have never been able to configure Wi-Fi to a working state, make sure your Wi-Fi supports 2.4 GHz signals. The console does not support Wi-Fi that uses the 5 GHz spectrum.

Make sure you configured the correct SSID and password. Repeat the procedure if necessary to verify.

## GPS Signal

### No GPS signal (no values of latitude, longitude and altitude)

1. Move your WXM-M5 outdoors (with the GPS antenna connected, if you use the external one)
   for a couple of minutes till “lon”, “lat” and “alt” values appear.
1. Then, move WXM-M5 indoors placing the GPS antenna next to a window.

If the problem remains and you use the internal GPS antenna, switch into the external antenna (see [Switch external/internal GPS antenna](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#switch-externalinternal-gps-antenna)).
