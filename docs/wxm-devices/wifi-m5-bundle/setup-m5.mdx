The weather station comes together with the WXM-M5 data miner.
The WXM-M5 receives all the meteorological data, which are measured and transmitted every 16 seconds by the outdoor sensor
and displays them on its screen.

In this chapter, you will find guidance to set up the WXM-M5.

## Device Installation

1. Find the power button at the left side of the WXM-M5 and press it for 2 seconds until the screen is on.
   Although the M5 has a battery, you need to permanently provide a power supply using the usb cable provided.
1. Once the screen is on, you should notice some icons [(Fig. 14a)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-14) on the top-right corner of the screen, which may appear in red color.
   If you have not already powered on your outdoor sensor, you may get “--” instead of measurements on the screen.
1. Swipe left on the touch screen and press “Configure WiFi” [(Fig. 14c)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-14)
   and reply “Yes'' to the message “This will reset your WiFi settings. Continue?” [(Fig. 14d)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-14).
1. The screen will be flashing and some guidelines will appear.
1. Use your mobile phone to connect to a WiFi network with the name “WXMMinerM5”. Allow some time until your phone connects successfully.
   If the process takes more than a couple of minutes, try the restart button at the bottom of the WXM-M5 or use another mobile phone, tablet or laptop/pc.
1. Once your device connects to “WXMMinerM5”, a list of all discovered WiFi networks will appear.
   Choose your 2.4 GHz capable Wi-Fi network, insert the WiFi password and press “Join”.
   Note that the WXM-M5's Wi-Fi chip is only compatible with 2.4 GHz capable Wi-Fi networks.
   In case no Wi-Fi list appears, open a browser, navigate to 10.10.0.1 and follow the previously mentioned process.
1. A message of success will appear on your phone/tablet/pc screen and the Wi-Fi icon on the WXM-M5’s screen will turn green.
   In addition, the date and time will be updated. Note that the time will appear in UTC.

If batteries have already been placed in the battery compartment of the outdoor sensor (see [Installing Batteries](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#installing-batteries)),
the data collected by the sensor should appear on the WXM-M5’s screen.
In addition, in the “WS” field (on the screen, you should see the “sensor id” number written under the outdoor sensor.
In case, there is no data on the screen, try to swipe left the screen again and press “Scan weather stations”.

Finally, (if you have the WXM-M5 beta V1) plug in the GPS antenna to the port on the gray board of the WXM-M5 [(Fig. 5)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/contents#figure-5)
and place the WXM-M5 next to a window. Then, swipe right on the screen.
In a couple of minutes, the variables “Lat”, “Lon” and “Alt” should present values
corresponding to your latitude, longitude and altitude of your area.
It is important to assure that the GPS antenna is properly connected and the indications mentioned above
are shown on the screen in order to participate in the WeatherXM rewarding programme.
If you use the internal GPS antenna, then assure that the WXM-M5 is close by the window.

## Registering the device to your account

You may claim your WXM-M5 data miner device via the application WeatherXM,
which can be downloaded from [Play Store for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weatherxm.app) or [App Store for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/weatherxm/id1629841929) or [via our web app](https://app.weatherxm.com).
Then, after registering and logging into your account, click on “+” and follow the instructions to claim your device.

## Change Frequency

The M5's frequency must be set to match the frequency of your weather station so it can listen for the weather data it transmits. There are 2 frequencies available:
- Model A: 868 frequency (default)
- Model B: 915 frequency

If your weather station is 868 MHz, you don't need to change anything as it is configured to this value by default.

### Steps to change the frequency
  1. Swipe left on the touch screen [(Fig. 15)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-15)
  1. Click the Frequency options and select the new frequency your M5 will listen to [(Fig. 15c)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-15)
  1. A confirmation dialog will open. Read it carefully and click "Yes" or "No" accordingly. [(Fig. 15d)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-15)

## M5 Antenna Troubleshooting

WXM-M5 is equipped with two antennas, the GPS and the LoRa. The GPS antenna is used to determine the location (coordinates) and altitude of the weather station,
while the LoRa antenna is responsible for the communication between the WXM-M5 and the outdoor sensor.

On the left side of the WXM-M5 you may notice that there are two different slices, a gray for GPS and a blue for LoRa.
Each of these slices contains a system relevant to the antennas mentioned above.

By default, the external GPS antenna and the internal RF/LoRa antenna are connected, and there is no need to modify this.

The antenna plugs are VERY SENSITIVE so it is NOT recommended to switch cables unless there is a serious problem.

### Switch external/internal GPS antenna

The WXM-M5 beta v1 uses by default the external GPS antenna, which should be connected to the port on the gray GPS slice [(Fig. 5)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/contents#figure-5).
In case you desire to change the internal/external GPS antenna, follow the following steps:

1. Unscrew and remove the four screws behind the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the first cap. You may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the cap from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. You will notice two small cables, one coming from the port on the side and one coming from a small chip.
   Remove the cable, which is connected to a specific reception on the green board and connect the desired cable to the same reception [(Fig. 16c)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-16).
1. Clasp the cap back and screw the device.
1. In case you changed to external GPS antenna, connect the external antenna to the corresponding port on the side of the WXM-M5 [(Fig. 5)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/contents#figure-5).

### Switch external/internal Radio Function (RF) - LoRa antenna

The WXM-M5 beta v1 uses by default the internal LoRa antenna [(Fig. 15)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-16).
In case you desire to change the internal/external LoRa antenna, follow the following steps:

1. Unscrew and remove the four screws behind the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the first cap. You may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the cap from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the gray GPS slice. Again you may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the slice from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. You will notice two small cables, one coming from the port on the side and one coming from an edge of the green board.
   Remove the cable, which is connected to a specific reception on the green board and
   connect the desired cable to the same reception [(Fig. 16b)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#figure-16).
1. Clasp the slices and the cap back and screw the device.
1. In case you changed to external LoRa antenna, connect the external antenna to the corresponding port on the side of the WXM-M5 [(Fig. 5)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/contents#figure-5).
