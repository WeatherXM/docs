## Main Parts

### Outdoor Weather Station

The outdoor sensor is a set of sensors encased in a plastic shell that ensures the proper function of the weather station.

The outdoor sensor is responsible for:

1. the collection of measurements of local temperature, humidity, rain, wind speed and wind direction, and
1. the wireless transmission of the data to the weather miner.

This part of your weather station is placed outdoors.
For further details about an advisable installation of the outdoor sensor, please see [Installing the M5 Weather Station](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-guide/install-weather-station).

The following figures show a sketch of the outdoor sensor. The sketch comes with a description of all the important parts and sensors of it.

#### Components

1. Wind Speed Sensor
1. Wind Vane
1. Thermo-hygro sensor
1. Rain collector
1. Bubble level
1. Solar panel
1. Antenna
1. Light sensor
1. U-Bolt
1. Battery compartment
1. Reset button
1. LED Indicator: light on for 4s on powers up. Then the LED will flash once every 16 seconds (the sensor transmission update period).

### M5 Miner

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-contents.png")} />

This is the device responsible for receiving weather measurements from the outdoor sensor and transmitting them via WiFi to IPFS and the WeatherXM IoT platform.

The weather miner is advised to be placed indoors, in an environment of relatively constant temperature (ideally within a daily range of <4Â°C for proper functioning of the barometer),
near a window (for better GPS signal). The weather miner should be permanently connected to power and activated in order to be able to receive, record and upload measurements to the internet.

The following scheme describes the buttons and connectivities of the WXM-M5 data miner. Briefly, there is a power and a reset button on the WXM-M5, a GPS port for the GPS antenna and a usb type-c port for power supply.
