## Good practice guides for placing the outdoor sensor

It is very important that your weather station collects quality measurements.
This turns the weather station into a powerful tool for yourself and WeatherXM.
The values of the various meteorological parameters measured by a weather station can significantly differ depending on the obstacles
and the material of the surfaces existing around the sensors. For this reason, there is a series of criteria that should be fulfilled:

1. The pole’s height, on which the outdoor sensor will be mounted, should be at least 2 meters.
   This means that the outdoor sensor should be placed at least 2 meters above the ground and any other horizontal
   or almost a horizontal surface (e.g., roof) above the sensor. The maximum acceptable pole height is 5 meters.

1. The pole should be adequately tightened in order to prevent any pole oscillations in cases of strong winds.
   This will prevent the rain gauge spoon from faulty swinging and collecting faulty precipitation measurements.

1. The pole together with the outdoor sensor should be placed in an installation point, which:
   1. is not affected by the air or smoke flowing out of any chimneys or ventilation systems
      (as an illustration, consider that wind of a certain direction may move warm smoke towards the sensors).
      An advisable distance from a heat source is >5 meters (depending on the heat source though),
      {" "}

      <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/building-with-pool-in-roof.png")} />

   1. is not shadowed by any obstacles during the day (consider that the sun typically is higher during summer and lower during winter affecting the shadow caused by an item) and

      <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/ws1000-shadow-soft.png")} />

   1. has a distance from any obstacles around, which 2-4 times larger than the height of the highest obstacle
      (e.g., if the highest obstacle around the installation point is a 6-meter tree, ht=6m,
      and the pole of the outdoor sensor is 2 meters, hp=2m, then the pole should be placed at a distance (dp) of 8-16 meters,
      2 x (ht-hp) < dp < 4 x (ht-hp). In case the pole is placed on a building’s roof,
      then the building’s height should be added to the pole’s height).
      Note that in cases of obstacles with a height >8 meters, you should consider placing the outdoor sensor
      at a distance 30 times the width and 15 times the height of the obstacles around.

## Mounting the outdoor sensor

#### Mounting and aligning sensor

If this is the first time that you set up this outdoor sensor,
then you should make sure that all the parts work properly before mounting the sensor on the pole outdoors.
Thus, it is important that you are able to read all the measurements on the weather miner’s screen,
while you keep the outdoor sensor nearby (preferably not closer than 1.5m from the weather miner though).

When you are about to fasten the pole on which you have tightened the outdoor sensor, look at the bubble level.
After fastening the pole, the bubble should be fully inside the red circle.
If it is not, wind direction, speed, and rain readings may not operate correctly or accurately.
Adjust the mounting pipe as necessary. If the bubble is close, but not quire inside the circle,
and you cannot adjust the mounting pole, you may try small wooden or heavy cardboard shims between the outdoor sensor
and the top of the mounting pole to achieve the desired result (this will require loosening the bolts and some experimentation).
Now, you may tighten the bolts with a wrench.


Note that all of i., ii. and iii. are important tips for measuring an accurate as possible temperature and humidity,
while iii. is important for avoiding faulty precipitation and wind measurements.

## Troubleshooting

### No communication between sensor and miner

In case that the communication between the weather miner and the outdoor sensor is problematic, please see [Troubleshooting](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/troubleshooting).

If the weather miner receives data in a proper way, then the outdoor sensor could be mounted on a metallic pole.
Before finally mounting the outdoor sensor, make sure that the communication between the sensor
and the weather miner still communicate appropriately.
Otherwise, you may consider placing the outdoor sensor in a smaller distance from the weather miner
and/or with no obstacles within this distance.
If the internal LORA antenna is used (default), the distance should not be larger than 50m with no obstacles along the line of sight.
In case of using the [external LoRa antenna](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#switch-externalinternal-radio-function-rf---lora-antenna), this distance may be extended to up to 100m.
Please check [Good practice guides for placing the outdoor sensor](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#good-practice-guides-for-placing-the-outdoor-sensor) for tips on how to find the most appropriate place to install the outdoor sensor.

After fixing any communication issues, the outdoor sensor can be mounted on a pole.
The two U-bolts can now be used together with the nuts to tighten the outdoor sensor on the pole (which is not included) as shown in [figure 9](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figure-9-10).
The U-bolts are able to “hug” a 1-2’’ (2.5-5cm) diameter pole.
It is very important that the arrow icon together with the “WEST” word on the outdoor sensor
(between the antenna and the light sensor as shown in [figure 10](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figures-9-10)) points to the real west direction in your location.
This can be confirmed with the assistance of a compass.
Permanent wind direction error will be introduced when the outdoor sensor is not installed in the right direction.
The orientation of this outdoor sensor remains the same for the southern hemisphere.

### Maintenance of the outdoor sensor

The maintenance of the outdoor sensor is an important process, which should be conducted meticulously over the suggested periods of time.
This process includes the cleansing of certain parts of the outdoor unit and the checking of the battery level.
The maintenance process is summarized in the following steps:

  #### Instructions for opening the rain gauge

1. Clean the rain gauge at least once every 3 months.
   Rotate the funnel counter-clockwise and lift to expose the rain gauge mechanism [(Fig. 12)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figure-12),
   and clean with a damp cloth. Remove any dirt, debris and insects.
   If bug infestation is an issue, spray the array lightly with insecticide.
   It is important not to swing the rain gauge spoon during this process,
   as the weather station will measure and record faulty precipitation.
   In order to avoid faulty measurements, you may turn off the M5 miner until finishing the entire process.


1. Clean the solar panel at least every 3 months with a damp cloth.
1. Remove any dirt, debris and insects from the thermo-hygro sensor every 12 months. It might be needed to open the radiation shield using a screwdriver and fully clean the thermo-hygro sensor in case there is too much debris on it.
1. Replace batteries every 1-2 years. If left in too long, the batteries may leak due to environmental challenges.
   In harsh environments, inspect the batteries every 3 months (e.g. when cleaning the solar panel).
   When replacing the batteries, apply a corrosion preventive compound on the battery terminals, available at most hardware stores
