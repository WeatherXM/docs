Setting up the current weather station is a process of several steps in order to make this system work properly
and measure weather conditions as accurately as possible.

### Installing U-bolts and metal plate

The U-bolts and the metal plate are used to support the mounting of the outdoor sensor on a pole.
The straight edge of the metal plate is inserted in a groove on the bottom of the unit (at the opposite side of the solar panel).
The curved part of the 90-degree angle bent edge of the metal plate should be oriented to the wind sensor in order to “hug” the mounting pole.
After inserting the metal plate, the U-bolts should be inserted through the respective holes of the metal plate [(Fig. 6)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figure-6).
Loosely screw the nuts on the ends of the U-bolts. They will be tightened later when mounting on the pole (see [Mounting the outdoor sensor](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#mounting-the-outdoor-sensor)).

This step is advised to be followed before mounting the wind vane and wind cup assembly in order to avoid damaging such parts.

### Assembling the wind sensor

The wind sensor consists of a part that measures the wind speed (through wind speed cup assembly)
and another that measures the wind direction (though wind vane).
Both wind speed cup assembly and wind vane should be pushed onto the shafts on the part of the outdoor sensor [(Figures 7a and 7c)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figure-7),
which is on the opposite side of the rain collector. Be sure that you place the wind cup assembly on the shaft at the top part of the sensor.
The wind vane should be placed on the shaft at the bottom of the sensor.
After pushing each of the parts, tighten the set screw, with a Philips screwdriver (size PH0) as shown in [(figures 7b and 7d)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figure-7).
Note that both parts should rotate freely. There should be no noticeable friction when the wind cup assembly rotates.
However, the wind vane’s movement has a small amount of friction, which assists in providing steady wind direction measurements.

### Installing batteries

Use a screwdriver to open the battery compartment and insert 2 AA batteries in it (Fig. 8).
Once the batteries are inserted, the LED indicator on the back of the sensor should turn on for 4 seconds
and then flash every 16 seconds indicating that the sensor transmits the data.
Note that the light flashing only indicates the transmission of the data from the outdoor sensor
and it does not assure the reception of the data by the weather miner.

#### Figure 8

**Rechargeable batteries should not be used**, as they provide lower voltages and lose power over time.
Solar panel is not trying to charge the batteries, but only provides power to an internal super capacitor,
thus no point using rechargeable ones.

Although alkaline batteries are sufficient for most climates, lithium non-rechargeable batteries could be used for cold weather climates.

The primary power source for the outdoor sensor is the solar panel. When available solar power (sun light) a super capacitor is charged
and is later used during night and when there is insufficient solar light.
In climates that frequently sustain temperatures below 0°C (or 32°F) the use of Lithium batteries is suggested
as these are performing better than Alkaline batteries under such circumstances, but depends on battery manufacturer and quality.

**Note 1:** In case that LED is permanently on or does not light up at all,
make sure that the batteries are inserted fully and in the correct way.

**Note 2:** Batteries should not be installed backwards. This may permanently damage the outdoor sensor.

**Note 3:** Do not forget to remove the black sticker from the solar panel.

### Mounting the outdoor sensor

If this is the first time that you set up this outdoor sensor,
then you should make sure that all the parts work properly before mounting the sensor on the pole outdoors.
Thus, it is important that you are able to read all the measurements on the weather miner’s screen,
while you keep the outdoor sensor nearby (preferably not closer than 1.5m from the weather miner though).

In case that the communication between the weather miner and the outdoor sensor is problematic, please see [Troubleshooting](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/troubleshooting).

If the weather miner receives data in a proper way, then the outdoor sensor could be mounted on a metallic pole.
Before finally mounting the outdoor sensor, make sure that the communication between the sensor
and the weather miner still communicate appropriately.
Otherwise, you may consider placing the outdoor sensor in a smaller distance from the weather miner
and/or with no obstacles within this distance.
If the internal LORA antenna is used (default), the distance should not be larger than 50m with no obstacles along the line of sight.
In case of using the [external LoRa antenna](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-m5#switch-externalinternal-radio-function-rf---lora-antenna), this distance may be extended to up to 100m.
Please check [Good practice guides for placing the outdoor sensor](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#good-practice-guides-for-placing-the-outdoor-sensor) for tips on how to find the most appropriate place to install the outdoor sensor.

After fixing any communication issues, the outdoor sensor can be mounted on a pole.
The two U-bolts can now be used together with the nuts to tighten the outdoor sensor on the pole (which is not included) as shown in [figure 9](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figure-9-10).
The U-bolts are able to “hug” a 1-2’’ (2.5-5cm) diameter pole.
It is very important that the arrow icon together with the “WEST” word on the outdoor sensor
(between the antenna and the light sensor as shown in [figure 10](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figures-9-10)) points to the real west direction in your location.
This can be confirmed with the assistance of a compass.
Permanent wind direction error will be introduced when the outdoor sensor is not installed in the right direction.
The orientation of this outdoor sensor remains the same for the southern hemisphere.

#### Figures 9-10

</div>

When you are about to fasten the pole on which you have tightened the outdoor sensor, look at the bubble level.
After fastening the pole, the bubble should be fully inside the red circle.
If it is not, wind direction, speed, and rain readings may not operate correctly or accurately.
Adjust the mounting pipe as necessary. If the bubble is close, but not quire inside the circle,
and you cannot adjust the mounting pole, you may try small wooden or heavy cardboard shims between the outdoor sensor
and the top of the mounting pole to achieve the desired result (this will require loosening the bolts and some experimentation).
Now, you may tighten the bolts with a wrench.

### Reset Button and Transmitter LED

Using a bent-open paperclip, press and hold the RESET BUTTON (Fig. 11) to affect a reset:
the LED turns on while the RESET button is depressed, and you can now let go.
The LED should then resume as normal, flashing approximately once every 16 seconds.

### Good practice guides for placing the outdoor sensor

It is very important that your weather station collects quality measurements.
This turns the weather station into a powerful tool for yourself and WeatherXM.
The values of the various meteorological parameters measured by a weather station can significantly differ depending on the obstacles
and the material of the surfaces existing around the sensors. For this reason, there is a series of criteria that should be fulfilled:

1. The pole’s height, on which the outdoor sensor will be mounted, should be at least 2 meters.
   This means that the outdoor sensor should be placed at least 2 meters above the ground and any other horizontal
   or almost a horizontal surface (e.g., roof) above the sensor. The maximum acceptable pole height is 5 meters.

       <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/roof-deployment.png")} />
     </div>
   </div>
1. The pole should be adequately tightened in order to prevent any pole oscillations in cases of strong winds.
   This will prevent the rain gauge spoon from faulty swinging and collecting faulty precipitation measurements.
1. The pole together with the outdoor sensor should be placed in an installation point, which:
   1. is not affected by the air or smoke flowing out of any chimneys or ventilation systems
      (as an illustration, consider that wind of a certain direction may move warm smoke towards the sensors).
      An advisable distance from a heat source is >5 meters (depending on the heat source though),

   1. is not shadowed by any obstacles during the day (consider that the sun typically is higher during summer and lower during winter affecting the shadow caused by an item) and

        </div>
      </div>
   1. has a distance from any obstacles around, which 2-4 times larger than the height of the highest obstacle
      (e.g., if the highest obstacle around the installation point is a 6-meter tree, ht=6m,
      and the pole of the outdoor sensor is 2 meters, hp=2m, then the pole should be placed at a distance (dp) of 8-16 meters,
      2 x (ht-hp) < dp < 4 x (ht-hp). In case the pole is placed on a building’s roof,
      then the building’s height should be added to the pole’s height).
      Note that in cases of obstacles with a height >8 meters, you should consider placing the outdoor sensor
      at a distance 30 times the width and 15 times the height of the obstacles around.

Note that all of i., ii. and iii. are important tips for measuring an accurate as possible temperature and humidity,
while c is important for avoiding faulty precipitation and wind measurements.

### Maintenance of the outdoor sensor

The maintenance of the outdoor sensor is an important process, which should be conducted meticulously over the suggested periods of time.
This process includes the cleansing of certain parts of the outdoor unit and the checking of the battery level.
The maintenance process is summarized in the following steps:

1. Clean the rain gauge at least once every 3 months.
   Rotate the funnel counter-clockwise and lift to expose the rain gauge mechanism [(Fig. 12)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figure-12),
   and clean with a damp cloth. Remove any dirt, debris and insects.
   If bug infestation is an issue, spray the array lightly with insecticide.
   It is important not to swing the rain gauge spoon during this process,
   as the weather station will measure and record faulty precipitation.
   In order to avoid faulty measurements, you may turn off the M5 miner until finishing the entire process.

1. Clean the solar panel at least every 3 months with a damp cloth.
1. Remove any dirt, debris and insects from the thermo-hygro sensor every 12 months. It might be needed to open the radiation shield using a screwdriver and fully clean the thermo-hygro sensor in case there is too much debris on it.
1. Replace batteries every 1-2 years. If left in too long, the batteries may leak due to environmental challenges.
   In harsh environments, inspect the batteries every 3 months (e.g. when cleaning the solar panel).
   When replacing the batteries, apply a corrosion preventive compound on the battery terminals, available at most hardware stores
