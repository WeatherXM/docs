Setting up the current weather station is a process of several steps in order to make this system work properly
and measure weather conditions as accurately as possible.

## Prerequisites for proper assemblance

1. Screwdriver (included)
1. Metal wrench (included)
1. Batteries, X3 AA (not included)

## Main Parts

### Outdoor Weather Station

The outdoor sensor is a set of sensors encased in a plastic shell that ensures the proper function of the weather station.

The outdoor sensor is responsible for:

1. the collection of measurements of local temperature, humidity, rain, wind speed and wind direction, and
1. the wireless transmission of the data to the weather miner.

This part of your weather station is placed outdoors.
For further details about an advisable installation of the outdoor sensor, please see [Installing the M5 Weather Station](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station).

The following figures show a sketch of the outdoor sensor. The sketch comes with a description of all the important parts and sensors of it.


### M5 Miner

<section class="explanation">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-contents.svg")} />
  <div>
    <h4>Components</h4>
    <p>
      This is the device responsible for receiving weather measurements from the outdoor sensor and transmitting them via WiFi to IPFS and the WeatherXM IoT platform.
      The weather miner is advised to be placed indoors, in an environment of relatively constant temperature (ideally within a daily range of &#60;4°C for proper functioning of the barometer),
      near a window (for better GPS signal). The weather miner should be permanently connected to power and activated in order to be able to receive, record and upload measurements to the internet.
      The following scheme describes the buttons and connectivities of the WXM-M5 data miner. Briefly, there is a power and a reset button on the WXM-M5, a GPS port for the GPS antenna and a usb type-c port for power supply.

## Step by step instructions

This step is advised to be followed before mounting the wind vane and wind cup assembly in order to avoid damaging such parts.
<br/>

### Installing U-bolts and metal plate

<div class="control">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/u-bracket-installation.svg")} />
</div>

#### U-bracket installation

The U-bolts and the metal plate are used to support the mounting of the outdoor sensor on a pole.
The straight edge of the metal plate is inserted in a groove on the bottom of the unit (at the opposite side of the solar panel).
The curved part of the 90-degree angle bent edge of the metal plate should be oriented to the wind sensor in order to “hug” the mounting pole.
After inserting the metal plate, the U-bolts should be inserted through the respective holes of the metal plate [(Fig. 6)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#figure-6).
Loosely screw the nuts on the ends of the U-bolts. They will be tightened later when mounting on the pole (see [Mounting the outdoor sensor](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/setup-weather-station#mounting-the-outdoor-sensor)).

### Assembling the wind sensor

<section class="explanation">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/ws1000-wind-vane-assembly.svg")} />
  <div>
    <h4>Wind cup assembly installation (a, b) and wind vane installation (c, d) diagrams</h4>
    <p>The wind sensor consists of a part that measures the wind speed (through wind speed cup assembly)
      and another that measures the wind direction (though wind vane).
      Both wind speed cup assembly and wind vane should be pushed onto the shafts on the part of the outdoor sensor,
      which is on the opposite side of the rain collector. Be sure that you place the wind cup assembly on the shaft at the top part of the sensor.
      The wind vane should be placed on the shaft at the bottom of the sensor.
      After pushing each of the parts, tighten the set screw, with a Philips screwdriver (size PH0).
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

:::note
Both parts should rotate freely. There should be no noticeable friction when the wind cup assembly rotates.
However, the wind vane’s movement has a small amount of friction, which assists in providing steady wind direction measurements.

### Installing batteries

<div class="control">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/battery-installation.svg")} />
</div>

#### Battery installation diagram

Use a screwdriver to open the battery compartment and insert 2 AA batteries in it (Fig. 8).
Once the batteries are inserted, the LED indicator on the back of the sensor should turn on for 4 seconds
and then flash every 16 seconds indicating that the sensor transmits the data.
Note that the light flashing only indicates the transmission of the data from the outdoor sensor
and it does not assure the reception of the data by the weather miner.

:::caution
**Rechargeable batteries should not be used**, as they provide lower voltages and lose power over time.
Solar panel is not trying to charge the batteries, but only provides power to an internal super capacitor,
thus no point using rechargeable ones.
:::

:::caution
Batteries should not be installed backwards. This may permanently damage the outdoor sensor.
:::

Although alkaline batteries are sufficient for most climates, lithium non-rechargeable batteries could be used for cold weather climates.

The primary power source for the outdoor sensor is the solar panel. When available solar power (sun light) a super capacitor is charged
and is later used during night and when there is insufficient solar light.
In climates that frequently sustain temperatures below 0°C (or 32°F) the use of Lithium batteries is suggested
as these are performing better than Alkaline batteries under such circumstances, but depends on battery manufacturer and quality.

:::note Note 1
**Do not forget to remove the black sticker from the solar panel.**
:::


:::note Note 2
In case that LED is permanently on or does not light up at all,
make sure that the batteries are inserted fully and in the correct way.
