Setting up the weather station is a process of several steps in order to make this system work properly
and measure weather conditions as accurately as possible.

## Prerequisites for proper assembly

1. Screwdriver (included)
1. Metal wrench (included)
1. Batteries, x2 AA (not included)

:::caution
In order to properly deploy the weather station, you will need two (2) AA batteries. These are not included in the box.

## Step by step instructions

### Assembling the wind sensor

<section class="explanation">

  <div>
    <h4>Wind cup assembly installation (a, b) and wind vane installation (c, d) diagrams</h4>
    <p>The wind sensor consists of a part that measures the wind speed (through wind speed cup assembly)
      and another that measures the wind direction (though wind vane).
      Both wind speed cup assembly and wind vane should be pushed onto the shafts on the part of the outdoor sensor,
      which is on the opposite side of the rain collector. Be sure that you place the wind cup assembly on the shaft at the top part of the sensor.
      The wind vane should be placed on the shaft at the bottom of the sensor.
      After pushing each of the parts, tighten the set screw with a Phillips screwdriver (size PH0).
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

:::note
Both parts should rotate freely. There should be no noticeable friction when the wind cup assembly rotates.
However, the wind vane’s movement has a small amount of friction, which assists in providing steady wind direction measurements.

### Installing batteries

<div class="control">

</div>

#### Battery installation diagram

Use a screwdriver to open the battery compartment and insert 2 AA batteries.
Once the batteries are inserted, the LED indicator on the back of the sensor should turn on for 4 seconds
and then flash every 16 seconds indicating that the sensor transmits the data.
Note that the LED flashing only indicates the transmission of the data from the outdoor sensor
and it does not assure the reception of the data by the M5 Miner.

:::caution
**Rechargeable batteries should not be used**, as they provide lower voltages and lose power over time.
Solar panel is not used for charging the batteries, but only provides power to an internal super capacitor,
thus no point in using rechargeable ones.
:::

:::caution
Batteries should not be installed backwards. This may permanently damage the outdoor sensor.
:::

Although alkaline batteries are sufficient for most climates, lithium non-rechargeable batteries could be used for cold weather climates.

The primary power source for the outdoor sensor is the solar panel. When solar power is available, a super capacitor is charged
and is later used during night and when there is insufficient solar light.
In climates that frequently sustain temperatures below 0°C (or 32°F) the use of lithium batteries is recommended
as these are performing better than alkaline batteries under such circumstances, but depend on battery manufacturer and quality.

#### Remove Sticker from Solar Panel

<div class="explanation">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/remove-sticker.svg")} />
<section>
  Remove the black sticker from the solar panel. If not, batteries will deplete and then the station will switch off.

:::note
In case that LED is permanently on or does not light up at all,make sure that the batteries are inserted fully and in the correct way.

### Installing U-bolts and metal plate

<div class="control">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/u-bracket-installation.svg")} />
</div>

#### U-bracket installation

The U-bolts and the metal plate are used to support the mounting of the outdoor sensor on a pole.
The straight edge of the metal plate is inserted in the groove at the bottom of the unit (at the opposite side of the solar panel).
The curved part of the 90-degree angle bent edge of the metal plate should be oriented to the wind sensor in order to “hug” the mounting pole.
After inserting the metal plate, the U-bolts should be inserted through the respective holes of the metal plate.
Loosely screw the nuts on the ends of the U-bolts. They will be tightened later when mounting on the pole (see [Mounting the outdoor sensor](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#mounting-the-outdoor-sensor)).
