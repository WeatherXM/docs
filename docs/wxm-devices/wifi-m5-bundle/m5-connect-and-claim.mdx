The weather station comes together with the M5 Miner.
The M5 Miner receives all the meteorological data, which are measured and transmitted every 16 seconds by the outdoor sensor
and displays them on its screen.

In this chapter, you will find guidance to set up the M5 Miner.

## Prerequisites

1. The station must be fully assembled (parts and batteries)
1. A working smartphone with connection to the internet

## Step by Step Instructions

### Connect GPS antenna

<section class="explanation">
  <img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/gps.svg")} />
  <span>
    Attach the GPS antenna to M5 Miner. You should hear a "click" when it's properly installed.
  </span>

### Connect M5 Miner to power source and turn device on

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/power-source.png")} />
  <span>
The M5 Miner must be connected to a power source at all times.
It has a limited battery, but you should not rely on it.

:::caution
If M5 turns off, you will not receive WXM rewards, as you will not be able to share data with the WeatherXM network. **This will result in no WXM rewards!**

### Place M5 near a window (for better GPS signal)

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/near-a-window.svg")} />
  <span>

For better GPS signal, it's highly recommended to place the M5 device near a window. Make sure that it has a good GPS coverage at all times.

:::note
This step could take some time till the device connects to GPS satellites.
:::

:::caution
If the GPS signal is lost, you could receive less WXM rewards (or none). This is because we will not be able to verify your location.

### Change Frequency (Optional)

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/frequency.svg")} />
  <span>

The M5 Miner's frequency must be set to match the frequency of your weather station so it can listen for the weather data it transmits. There are 2 frequencies available:
- Model A: 868 MHz (default)
- Model B: 915 MHz

:::note
**If your weather station is 868 MHz, you don't need to change anything as it is configured to this value by default.**
If unsure, check the sticker under the station or the box that came in it.

:::
  </span>
</section>


### Steps to change the frequency
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-change-frequency.png")} />

  1. Swipe left on the touch screen
  1. Click the Frequency options and select the new frequency your M5 Miner will listen to
  1. A confirmation dialog will open. Read it carefully and click "Yes" or "No" accordingly

:::caution
If you don't use the correct frequency as your weather station, M5 Miner will not be able to communicate with your weather station, thus you will not send any weather data and receive no WXM rewards!

### Connect M5 Miner to WiFi

<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-first-run.png")} />


By now, your M5 Miner is set and ready for claiming!
Swipe left to navigate to the settings screen. There, tap on "Tap on "Configure WiFi" to get M5 to switch to connect mode.

Once this is done, connect to M5 Miner via WiFi (you should see in the networks screen a "WXMMinerM5").

A popup will open, asking you to select the desired network you'd like to connect the M5 Miner. Select the one you want and provide the password for it.

:::note
Once the WiFi credentials have been successfully transfered to M5 Miner, the device will reboot and the WiFi icon will turn green!

    <h4>Start the Claiming Process</h4>
    <p>
      Once you've logged into your WeatherXM app, you will see an empty device list (assuming this is your first station setup). Tap the "+" button at the bottom right corner. Tap it to start the claiming process of your station. Once you've done this, you'll be able to view all data of this station, and get the WXM rewards!

### Type the M5 Miner serial number when prompted


<section class="explanation small-big">

  <span>

#### Navigate to M5 Miner Settings and find the device's Serial Number

Follow the steps shown in the image below to find your M5 Miner's Serial Number. You'll need to type this in the WeatherXM app in order to verify that you own this station and secure it for yourself.

### Confirm station installation Location & Claim your Device


<section class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/installation-location.png")} />
  <span>

#### Select the Location that you'll Install your Station

Allow access to your location so that the WeatherXM app knows where you are planning to install your weather station. Doing so will make it easier to complete this step.

Alternatively, you can find the location manually using the map.

Once you've found the right location, tap on the checkbox to confirm and then tap on "Claim" button.
That's it! You've now claimed your new weather station and you'll be able to see its data on your WeatherXM app!

All you need to do now, is to add your compatible wallet so you can receive WXM rewards. To do so, please follow the instructions in the chapter ["Adding Wallets"](/wallet/adding-wallet). **Remember that as of today, the WXM token is on testnet!**

:::note
We do not track you, nor do we collect any data about your location.
:::

:::caution
Make sure you define the location that you will install your station as precisely as possible, as this will play apart on the quality of data you will share with the network and thus your overall WXM rewards.
