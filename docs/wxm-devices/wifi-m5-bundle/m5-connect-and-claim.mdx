The weather station comes together with the WXM-M5 data miner.
The WXM-M5 receives all the meteorological data, which are measured and transmitted every 16 seconds by the outdoor sensor
and displays them on its screen.

In this chapter, you will find guidance to set up the WXM-M5.

## Prerequisites

1. The station must be fully assembled (parts and batteries)
1. A working smartphone with connection to the internet

## Step by Step Instructions

### Connect GPS antenna

### Connect M5 to power source and turn device on

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/power-source.png")} />
  <span>
The M5 must be connected to a power source at all times.
It has a limited battery, but you should not rely on it and keep it away from its power source.

:::caution
If M5 turns off, you will not receive WXM rewards, as you won't be able to share data with the Network. **This will result in no WXM rewards!**

### Place M5 near a window (for better GPS signal)

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/near-a-window.svg")} />
  <span>

For better GPS signal, it's highly recommended to place the M5 device near a window. Make sure that it has a good GPS coverage at all times.

:::note
This step could take some time till the device connects to GPS satellites.
:::

:::caution
If the GPS signal is lost, you could receive less WXM rewards (or none). This is because we won't be able to verify your location.

### Change Frequency (Optional)

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/frequency.svg")} />
  <span>

The M5's frequency must be set to match the frequency of your weather station so it can listen for the weather data it transmits. There are 2 frequencies available:
- Model A: 868 frequency (default)
- Model B: 915 frequency

:::note
**If your weather station is 868 MHz, you don't need to change anything as it is configured to this value by default.**
:::
  </span>
</section>


### Steps to change the frequency
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-change-frequency.png")} />

  1. Swipe left on the touch screen
  1. Click the Frequency options and select the new frequency your M5 will listen to
  1. A confirmation dialog will open. Read it carefully and click "Yes" or "No" accordingly

:::caution
If you don't use the correct frequency as your station, M5 won't be able to communicate with your station, thus you will not share any data, and receive no WXM rewards!

### Connect M5 to WiFi

<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-first-run.png")} />


By now, your M5 is set and ready for claiming!
Swipe left to navigate to M5 settings screen. There, tap on "configure WiFi" to get M5 to switch to connect mode.

Once this is done, connect to M5 via WiFi (you should see in the networks screen a "WXMMinerM5").

A popup will open, asking you to select the desired network you'd like to connect the M5. Select the one you want, and provide the password for it.

:::note
Once the WiFi credentials have been successfully transferred to M5 Miner, the device will reboot, and the WiFi icon will turn green!

### Confirm station installation Location & Claim your Device


<section class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/installation-location.png")} />
  <span>

#### Select the Location that you'll Install your Station

Allow access to you location so that the WXM app knows where you are planning to install your WeatherXM Station. Doing so, will make it easier to complete this step.

Alternatively, you can find the location manually using the map.

Once you've found the right location, tap on the checkbox to acknowledge the correctness of the installation location, and then tap on "Claim" button.
That's it! You;ve now claimed your new WeatherXM Station, and you'll be able to see it's data on your WeatherXM apps!

All you need to do now, is to add your compatible wallet so you can receive WXM rewards. To do so, please follow the instructions in the chapter ["Adding Wallets"](/wallet/adding-wallet). **Remember that as of today, the WXM token is on testnet!**

:::note
We do not track you, nor do we collect any data about your location.
:::

:::caution
Make sure you define the location that you will install your station as precise as possible, as this will play it'a part on the quality of data you will share with the network, and thus your overall WXM rewards.
