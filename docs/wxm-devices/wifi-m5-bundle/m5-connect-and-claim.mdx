The weather station comes together with the M5 Miner.
The M5 Miner receives all the meteorological data, which are measured and transmitted every 16 seconds by the outdoor sensor
and displays them on its screen.


In this chapter, you will find guidance to set up the M5 Miner.
<hr/>

## Prerequisites

1. The station must be fully assembled (parts and batteries).
1. A working smartphone with connection to the internet.
3. A reliable 2.4 GHz WiFi network (5 GHz is not supported) for the M5 Miner to connect to.

<hr/>



## Step by Step Instructions

### Connect GPS antenna

<div class="explanation">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/gps.png")} />
  <span>
    Attach the GPS antenna to M5 Miner. You should hear a "click" when it's properly installed.
  </span>
</div>

<hr/>

### Connect M5 Miner to power source and turn device on

<div class="explanation">
<img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/power-source.png")} />
  <span>
  <p>
    The M5 Miner must be connected to a power source at all times.
    It has a limited battery, but you should not rely on it.
  </p>

:::caution
If M5 turns off, you will not receive WXM rewards, as you will not be able to share data with the WeatherXM network. **This will result in no WXM rewards!**
:::
  </span>
</div>

<hr/>


### Place M5 near a window (for better GPS signal)

<div class="explanation">
<img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/near-a-window.png")} />
  <span>

For better GPS signal, it's highly recommended to place the M5 device near a window. Make sure that it has a good GPS coverage at all times.

:::note
This step could take some time till the device connects to GPS satellites.
:::

:::caution
If the GPS signal is lost, you could receive less WXM rewards (or none). This is because we will not be able to verify your location.

### Change Frequency (Optional)


<div class="explanation">

<Tabs groupId="wg1000_ui">
  <TabItem value="wg1000_ui_new" label="UI versions > 0.10.0">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/frequency-new.png")} />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wg1000_ui_old" label="Older UI versions">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/frequency.png")} />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

  <span>

The M5 Miner's frequency must be set to match the frequency of your weather station so it can listen for the weather data it transmits. There are 2 frequencies available:
- Model A: 868 MHz (default)
- Model B: 915 MHz

:::note
**If your weather station is 868 MHz, you don't need to change anything as it is configured to this value by default.**
If unsure, check the sticker under the station or the box that came in it.
:::
  </span>
</div>

### Steps to change the frequency
<div>

  <Tabs groupId="wg1000_ui">
  <TabItem value="wg1000_ui_new" label="UI versions > 0.10.0">
    <img class="control" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-change-frequency-new.png")} />
    <ol>
        <li>Swipe right on the touch screen</li>
        <li>Click the Frequency options and select the new frequency your M5 Miner will listen to</li>
        <li>A confirmation dialog will open. Read it carefully and click "Continue" or "Cancel" accordingly</li>
    </ol>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wg1000_ui_old" label="Older UI versions">
    <img class="control" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-change-frequency.png")} />
    <ol>
        <li>Swipe left on the touch screen</li>
        <li>Click the Frequency options and select the new frequency your M5 Miner will listen to</li>
        <li>A confirmation dialog will open. Read it carefully and click "Yes" or "No" accordingly</li>
    </ol>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

</div>

:::caution
If you don't use the correct frequency as your weather station, M5 Miner will not be able to communicate with your weather station, thus you will not send any weather data and receive no WXM rewards!

### Connect M5 Miner to WiFi

<Tabs groupId="wg1000_ui">
  <TabItem value="wg1000_ui_new" label="UI versions > 0.10.0">
    <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-configure-wifi-new.png")} />

By now, your M5 Miner is set and ready for claiming!
Swipe right to navigate to the settings screen. There, tap on "Configure WiFi" to switch to connect mode.

Once this is done, connect to M5 Miner via WiFi (you should see in the networks screen a "WXMMinerM5").

A popup will open, asking you to select the desired network you'd like to connect the M5 Miner. Select the one you want and provide the password for it.

  <div style={{width:"calc(100%*2/3 - 10px)"}} >

#### Navigate to M5 Miner and find the device's Serial Number

Follow the steps shown in the image below to find your M5 Miner's Serial Number. You'll need to type this in the WeatherXM app in order to verify that you own this station and secure it for yourself.

### Confirm station installation Location & Claim your Device


<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/installation-location.svg")} />
  <span>

#### Select the Location that you'll Install your Station

Allow access to your location so that the WeatherXM app knows where you are planning to install your weather station. Doing so will make it easier to complete this step.

Alternatively, you can find the location manually using the map.

Once you've found the right location, tap on the checkbox to confirm and then tap on "Claim" button.

All you need to do now, is to add your compatible wallet so you can receive WXM rewards. To do so, please follow the instructions in the chapter  ["Add/edit wallet address"](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address#how-to-create-wallet-on-metamask). **Remember that as of today, the WXM token is on testnet!**

That's it! You've now claimed your new weather station and you'll be able to see its data on your WeatherXM app!

:::note
We do not track you, nor do we collect any data about your location.
:::

:::caution
Make sure you define the location that you will install your station as precisely as possible, as this is important for the quality of data you will share with the network and thus your overall WXM rewards.
:::

:::caution
Your first rewards will appear after 24 hours of the station being online.
