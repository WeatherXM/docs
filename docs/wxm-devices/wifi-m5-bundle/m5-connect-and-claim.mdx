The weather station comes together with the WXM-M5 data miner.
The WXM-M5 receives all the meteorological data, which are measured and transmitted every 16 seconds by the outdoor sensor
and displays them on its screen.

In this chapter, you will find guidance to set up the WXM-M5.

## Prerequisites

1. The station must be fully assembled (parts and batteries)

## Step by Step Instructions

### Connect GPS antenna

  <span>
    Attach the GPS antenna to M5. you should hear a "click" when it's properly installed.

If the installation of the station and the placement of the M5 miner is more than 50m apart, you must install the LoraWan antenna so that the two can communicate over such distance.
Please follow the instructions below, or on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP4rT3FTz0M&t" target="blank">video</a>.

:::caution
If the station and M5 are more than 50m apart, you must install the LoraWan antenna

#### M5 Antenna Troubleshooting

WXM-M5 is equipped with two antennas, the GPS and the LoRa. The GPS antenna is used to determine the location (coordinates) and altitude of the weather station,
while the LoRa antenna is responsible for the communication between the WXM-M5 and the outdoor sensor.

On the left side of the WXM-M5 you may notice that there are two different slices, a gray for GPS and a blue for LoRa.
Each of these slices contains a system relevant to the antennas mentioned above.

By default, the external GPS antenna and the internal RF/LoRa antenna are connected, and there is no need to modify this.

The antenna plugs are VERY SENSITIVE so it is NOT recommended to switch cables unless there is a serious problem.

#### Switch external/internal GPS antenna

The WXM-M5 beta v1 uses by default the external GPS antenna, which should be connected to the port on the gray GPS slice
In case you desire to change the internal/external GPS antenna, follow the following steps:

1. Unscrew and remove the four screws behind the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the first cap. You may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the cap from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. You will notice two small cables, one coming from the port on the side and one coming from a small chip.
   Remove the cable, which is connected to a specific reception on the green board and connect the desired cable to the same reception.
1. Clasp the cap back and screw the device.
1. In case you changed to external GPS antenna, connect the external antenna to the corresponding port on the side of the WXM-M5.

#### Switch external/internal Radio Function (RF) - LoRa antenna

The WXM-M5 beta v1 uses by default the internal LoRa antenna.
In case you desire to change the internal/external LoRa antenna, follow the following steps:

1. Unscrew and remove the four screws behind the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the first cap. You may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the cap from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. Remove the gray GPS slice. Again you may use a flat-head screwdriver to separate the slice from the rest of the WXM-M5.
1. You will notice two small cables, one coming from the port on the side and one coming from an edge of the green board.
   Remove the cable, which is connected to a specific reception on the green board and
   connect the desired cable to the same reception.
1. Clasp the slices and the cap back and screw the device.
1. In case you changed to external LoRa antenna, connect the external antenna to the corresponding port on the side of the WXM-M5.

##### Internal parts of the WXM-M5

- (a) Bottom is the first cap you remove once the WXM-M5 is unscrewed.
- (b) The gray GPS is the second slice
- (c) the blue RF LoRa is the third slice
- (d) The TOP is the rest of WXM-M5 device.

### Connect M5 to power source and turn device on

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/hardware-parts.png")} />
  <span>
The M5 must be connected to a power source at all times.
It has a limited battery, but you should not rely on it and keep it away from its power source.

:::caution
If M5 turns off, you will not receive WXM rewards, as you won't be able to share data with the Network. **This will result in no WXM rewards!**
:::
  </span>

### Place M5 near a window (for better GPS singal)

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/hardware-parts.png")} />
  <span>

For better GPS signal, it's highly recommended to place the M5 device near a window. Make sure that it has a good GPS coverage at all times.

:::note
This step could take some time till the device connects to GPS satellites.
:::

:::caution
If the GPS signal is lost, you could receive less WXM rewards (or none). This is because we won't be able to verify your location.

### Change Frequency

<section class="explanation">
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/hardware-parts.png")} />
  <span>

The M5's frequency must be set to match the frequency of your weather station so it can listen for the weather data it transmits. There are 2 frequencies available:
- Model A: 868 frequency (default)
- Model B: 915 frequency

:::note
**If your weather station is 868 MHz, you don't need to change anything as it is configured to this value by default.**
:::
  </span>
</section>


#### Steps to change the frequency
<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-change-frequency.png")} />

  1. Swipe left on the touch screen
  1. Click the Frequency options and select the new frequency your M5 will listen to
  1. A confirmation dialog will open. Read it carefully and click "Yes" or "No" accordingly

:::caution
If you don't use the correct frequency as your station, M5 won't be able to communicate with your station, thus you will not share any data, and receive no WXM rewards!

### Connect M5 to WiFi

<img class="marginTop" src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-first-run.png")} />


By now, your M5 is set and ready for claiming!
Swipe left to navigate to M5 settings screen. There, tap on "configure WiFi" to get M5 to switch to connect mode.

Once this is done, connect to M5 via WiFi (you should see in the networks screen a "WXM M5 Something").

A popup will open, asking you to select the desired network you'd like to connect the M5. Select the one you want, and provide the password for it.

### Confirm station installation Location


<section class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/installation-location.png")} />
  <span>

#### Select the Location that you'll Install your Station

Allow access to you location so that the WXM app knows where you are planning to install your WeatherXM Station. Doing so, will make it easier to complete this step.

:::note
We do not track you, nor do we collect any data about your location.
:::

:::caution
Make sure you define the location that you will install your station as precise as possible, as this will play it'a part on the quality of data you will share with the network, and thus your overall WXM rewards.
