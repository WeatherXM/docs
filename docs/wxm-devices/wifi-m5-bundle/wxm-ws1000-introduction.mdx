## Next steps

You just got your station, or, you will soon!
Let's see what are the necessary steps in order to properly assemble, install, claim, and enable it to send data and WXM reward tokens.

### Check the box contents

Make sure that everything is in order, and you're all set to proceed with station assembly.

### Assemble your weather station

Assemble all parts and make sure all sensors will work as expected. For this step, **you will need 2 AA batteries that are not included in the box.**

### Install your weather stations

This is one of the most important steps, as proper installation is key in order to collect valid weather data. For this step, **you will need a pole that is a least 2 meters / 6.56 feet, and a way to secure it in place (both not included in the box).** Here you will also see the best practices on how to properly install the station according to WMO.

### Connect and claim station

Once you've finished with installation, you can connect your station to your M5 miner, and claim them as your own in WeatherXM network. To do this, **you will need to download our WeatherXM app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weatherxm.app&hl=en&gl=US" target="blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/weatherxm/id1629841929" target="blank">iOS</a>).**

### Add your ERC20 compatible wallets

In order to receive WXM rewards, you will need to connect a ERC20 compatible wallet. For the purposes of viewing your tokens while in Testnet, we have prepared a guide to do so using MetaMask (although it is not mandatory to use this).
