## Weather And Science at WeatherXM

Welcome to the **Weather And Science** section — a hub for our scientific work, technical studies, and exploratory projects in meteorology and atmospheric science.
Here you’ll find **peer-reviewed papers, whitepapers, technical reports, and experimental findings** from the WeatherXM team and our collaborators.

Our research spans multiple domains, including:
- **Hyperlocal Weather Data** — methods for collecting, validating, and analysing data from our global network of weather stations.
- **Forecasting & Modelling** — blending traditional meteorological models with machine learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Climate & Environmental Insights** — studying long-term patterns, microclimates, and the effects of extreme weather events.
- **Web3 & Weather Data Economics** — exploring decentralized data marketplaces, tokenized incentives, and the future of open-access meteorology.

By publishing our findings openly, we aim to:
- Contribute to **global scientific understanding** of weather and climate.
- Support **innovation in open-source meteorology**.
- Empower developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to **build on our work**.

Whether you’re a scientist, a developer, or simply curious about how technology can transform weather science — you’ll find something here to explore, learn from, and use.
