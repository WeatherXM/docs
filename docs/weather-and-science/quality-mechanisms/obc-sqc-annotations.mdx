# Out-of-Bounds (OBC) and Self Quality Checks (SQC) Annotations

The QoD algorithm produces annotation codes associated with various weather parameters to provide a detailed description of a specific condition for each parameter. These codes serve as a standard format of communication between the various services that use them and they will be mapped to user-friendly messages on the clients.

## Parameters under Investigation

The following is a table of all parameters characterized by QoD.

Note that there are two spike annotations. The one arises in raw level and the other in minute level. In order to distinguish between them, we refer to the raw spike annotation as SPIKE_INST and to the minute spike as ANOMALOUS_INCREASE. Thus, SPIKE_INST implies that there was an instant spike in one or more of the data packets that we received and is highly likely to be due to faulty sensor and less (but still) likely to be due to bad deployment. On the other hand, ANOMALOUS_INCREASE implies that there was suspicious change when comparing consecutive minute averages. This could be possibly due to bad deployment (e.g., gradual increase in temperature due to a chimney that started working), but we cannot exclude the case of faulty sensor.
UNIDENTIFIED_SPIKE and UNIDENTIFIED_ANOMALOUS_CHANGE label all values that appear suspicious for spikes or dips, in contrast to "SPIKE_INST" and "ANOMALOUS_INCREASE" annotations, which exclusively label the spike or dip value itself. This implies that the user will receive a different Quality of Data (QoD) score if either of the first two annotations is activated, compared to the two latter annotations.
