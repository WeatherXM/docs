# Quality Mechanisms

In this section, all the available quality mechanisms are fully described.

## Contents

- [**General QoD Description (OBC-SQC, ISD, SPV)**](/weather-and-science/quality-mechanisms/general-qod-description.mdx): General and brief description of all the available quality mechanisms.
- [**Indoors Station Detector (ISD)**](/weather-and-science/quality-mechanisms/isd-full-documentation.mdx): Full documentation of the Indoors Station Detector (ISD), which is the mechanism that detects stations placed indoors, but also some other problematic situations.
- [**OBC and SQC Annotations**](/weather-and-science/quality-mechanisms/obc-sqc-annotations.mdx): Description of the annotations produced by the OBC-SQC quality mechanism.
- [**Out-of-Bounds (OBC) and Self Quality Checks (SQC)**](/weather-and-science/quality-mechanisms/obc-sqc-documentation.mdx): Full documentation of the Out-of-Bounds Check (OBC) and Self-Quality-Check (SQC) mechanism, which focuses on the detection of suspicious data in the transmitted raw data.
- [**OBC and SQC Score Calculation**](/weather-and-science/quality-mechanisms/obc-sqc-score-calculation.mdx): The method of the final daily OBC-SQC score calculation.
- [**Station Photo Verification (SPV)**](/weather-and-science/quality-mechanisms/spv-full-documentation.mdx): Full documentation of the Station Photo Verification (SPV) mechanism, which aims to evaluate the station deployments via photos.
