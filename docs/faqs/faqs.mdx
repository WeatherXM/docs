  ### Wind gusts are lower than I expect. Why?

  Firstly, you need to check if your M5 is up-to-date with the latest firmware version (>=0.3.22). Secondly, you need to check that the outdoor sensor has no obstacles around. Here there is a tricky point. We firstly say that the outdoor sensor needs to be `2 x height_of_obstacle`, because even this criterion is not always doable and because the other sensors are ok with this criterion. However, the WMO criteria here for wind are: a.The wind sensor shall be sited so that any obstacle taller than 4m shall be at a distance equal to 10 times its height. For example, if an obstacle is 6m tall, it shall be no closer than 60m to the wind sensor and b. The wind sensor shall be sited so that any obstacle taller than 8m shall be at a distance of more than 15 times its width. For example, there is a tower that is 9m tall and 10m wide, then the wind sensor shall be sited more than 150m away
  
    
  <hr />

  ### How do you know people are not faking the location of their station on the map?

  We use proof of location protocols.

  <hr />

  ### Is there a chance for my host/friend to be able to have access at my station's data?

  We will have a "follow a station" feature soon so that guests or hosts will be able to have their own accounts.
  
  <hr />

  ### Why is my UV index 0?

  Ensure that the black cover has been removed from the solar panel.

  ## <Highlight color="#68a4f9">Hardware</Highlight>

  ### What is the ideal distance between stations?

  Is a number that will vary depending on land morphology, local weather characteristics, and the WeatherXM network density.
  
  <hr />

  ### Can I connect my WXM station with a 3rd party station?

  Our weather stations are custom built, they are developed to connect to our network with our firmware and software implementations. Our next milestone is to develop the SDR miner where third party stations will be able to connect and join our network.
  
  <hr />

  ### What are the differences between the WXM WiFi M5 station and the WXM Helium compatible station?

  <ol>
    <li>
      The Helium station has an integrated (located within the weather station) Helium-compatible LoRaWAN chip, crypto chip, and GPS while the Wi-Fi bundle has a Wi-Fi gateway, crypto chip, and GPS located within the external M5 gateway. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Helium station can only connect to the Helium Network while the Wi-Fi bundle can only connect to Wi-Fi.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Helium station has a larger solar panel which allows it to do processing standalone (in the station itself) while the Wi-Fi bundle's station has a smaller solar panel since the processing is done by the external M5 display and Wi-Fi gateway (located indoors) which the station communicates to over LoRa.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Helium bundle does not contain any type of display to view weather data. Weather data will have to be viewed from the WeatherXM app.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <hr />

  ### Can I connect my Helium compatible station to any Helium around or should I request access from someone?

  You can connect your Helium compatible station anywhere with Helium network coverage or near a Helium gateway.

  <hr />

  ### Will it make a big difference if I place my station on the balcony instead of the roof?

  It is recommended that you place your station on the roof and the reason is because there aren't so many obstacles as there are on a balcony (e.g walls), that will reduce the quality of your data, therefore the amount of your rewards.
  
  <hr />

  ### Does the weather station need to be powered by USB?

  The outdoor sensor contains a super capacitor and a solar panel as well as an input for 2 AA batteries so it doesn't need to be powered by USB, but the M5 which is an indoor device should always be powered by USB.
  
  <hr />

  ### Is any of your stations suitable for very cold climates? 

  For very cold climates that have snow most of the year, we will be launching soon a special weather station with a heater suitable for these weather conditions. 

  <hr/>

  ### If I have a wifi repeater, will it affect my M5 connection?

  Yes, usually wifi issues for M5 are caused from repeaters.
  
  <hr />

  ### What kind of batteries should I use for my station? 

  The batteries used must be Lithium AA non-rechargeable.

  <hr/>

  ### It has rained through the day but M5 shows 0mm/h. Is there a problem with my sensor?

  No. For now the M5 screen shows only the instant rain rate, which is measured in millimeters per hour (mm/h). This parameter indicates the intensity of rain occurring ath the moment we look at M5. In the future we may add total daily precipitation on M5 screen.
  
  <hr />

  ### Pressure on M5 appears to be very low relatively to other reference stations of national or private networks etc. Why?

  For now we present only the absolute pressure and not the Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP). That means that the displayed pressure are affected by the elevation of your area. We work to consider the elevation given by your GPS in order to show the MSLP, which is commonly used.
  
  <hr />

  ### If I place my station somewhere that it doesn't show a pre-existing Hex in your explorer, is there going to be a new Hex for me or will I get in the Hex that already exists?

  We don't have the exact meters to tell you yet, but it seems you will have your own Hex.Your station should be 2.5-5 km far from the other station.
  
  <hr />

  ### Which is the recommended frequency for my country?

  We approximately follow the [frequency assignments of
  TTN per country](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/frequencies-by-country/).


## <Highlight color="#68a4f9">Rewards</Highlight>

  ### What time do the rewards appear everyday?

  Rewards appear once a day at 05:00 PM UTC.
  
  <hr />

  ### Will the mainnet launch take place only after 10k/20k stations are online?

  This was our initial estimation but if we were able to test the network with the current available stations, so the number of stations online is not a limitation any more.
  
  <hr />

  ### How can one contribute to tokenomics?

  You can contribute by completing this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4enJItd1l0lJWx6pEcAQCoMJ1OvihVbfGe1hB2jtVLUnE2w/viewform).
  
  <hr />

  ### How can I start receiving rewards?

  If you have already set up your station and claimed your device via the app, please add Metamask and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.weatherxm.com/account/creating-wallet).

  ### When will mainnet launch?

  According to our [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_z-sdCoSpm7H5kH0Ko8grUn7IatmAObSdkQULr21YGc/edit)
  we will launch our token in Q4 2023.

  <hr />

  ### Will testnet tokens be converted to real tokens after token launch?

  Testnet tokens don't have any value and are used for testing purposes but in any case all beta testers will get some extra rewards in the form of an Airdrop when the token launch takes place.
  
  <hr />

  ### Do I have to pay for the HNT/DC fees?

  We are covering the HNT/DC fees.
  
  <hr />

  ### Will I get rewarded if I place a weather station in a big city like the one I live in ?

  If you have a proper setup you will be rewarded according to the accuracy and quality of your data, therefore you can be fully rewarded.
  
  <hr />

  ### Why did the rewards get reduced?

  This is because more stations were added to our network.
  
  <hr />

  ### Why did I stop getting rewards?

  There are many factors:
  - First, ensure a connection between the station and the M5. 
  - Ensure that all three signals in the right-up corner on your M5 are green.
  - It is important to have connected to your wallet.
  - If the issue persists contact us at hello@weatherxm.com.

<hr />

  ### Can I change my wallet address in the future?

  For now we support only MetaMask as it has a very good testnet support and our dev team prefer it. When we move on Mainnet you will be able to use your preferable wallet.

  There will be no issue as long as the stations will be sending accurate weather data.

  <hr/>

  ### In order for the Helium stations to work, should they be in a Helium hexagon or the principle is the same as for the WiFi stations?

  Helium weather stations transmit data by using the helium network. In order to work properly they should be in a place where there is Helium coverage.
  
  <hr />

  ### Can one device be added to two multiple phones so two people can monitor it?

  Currently, you can login to the app from multiple phones.
  
  <hr />

  ### Will the Helium compatible station use my hotspot or will it be assigned to the new one? And how long will the batteries last?

  It uses the nearest hotspot and we are not able yet to know in which hotspot it will be assigned. The batteries last for about 2 years due to the super capacitor which stores energy from the solar panel.
  
  <hr />

  ### Is the exact location of my station shown on the explorer?

  The location shown is approximate for security reasons.

  <hr/>
