A guide to interpreting mobile app error messages, understanding their meanings, and taking appropriate actions to resolve them.

## No wallet

It seems that you haven't connected a wallet to your account yet. Please note that in order to receive rewards, you must connect a wallet address. Here's what you need to do:

1. Learn [how to add or edit a wallet address](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address).
2. Then, follow the instructions for [joining Arbitrum One and see your $WXM tokens](/wallet/how-to-join-arbitrum-and-see-your-tokens).

Once you've completed the above steps, you'll be all set to claim your rewards. Please wait until the [Reward Mechanism (RM) ](/reward-mechanism) completes. This usually takes until the following day and see "[How to Claim Rewards](/project/rewards-claiming)" for further guidance.

## No Station Data

It seems that your station did not transmit any data at all, which may indicate that it was either offline or not connected to the network.


Here's what you need to do:

### For the WG1000 WiFi gateway

<div class="explanation">
   <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/project/m5-ui-new_numbered.jpg")} />
  <div>
    <h4>WG1000 Gateway icons explanation <br/> 
    Red=Problem, Green= Good</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>RF connection with the station.</li>
      <li>Connection to WeatherXM Network.</li>
      <li>GPS receiver.</li>
      <li>WiFi connection.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

- Check that your station connection (RF) to the gateway is stable by following the guide [here](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#weather-station-not-reporting-data-to-m5-miner-there-are-dashes----on-the-display-console).


- Also read through the guide to add the included external antenna [here](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#my-station-does-not-connect-to-the-m5-miner). 
- Check if the station's battery level is low through mobile app settings.
If the battery is low, the connection between your station and the WG1000 gateway will be unstable resulting in data loss.

## Sensor Problems

If you got this error, it means our data evaluation services detected that the received weather packets, did not meet our quality standards. 
To ensure the accuracy of the information sent by our weather stations, we evaluate all data packets using our [Quality of Data (QoD) algorithm](/project/quality-of-data). For more information about this algorithm, please refer to this [here](/project/quality-of-data). 

Below are some of the possible errors and the appropriate actions you can take to resolve the issues:


#### Out of Bounds Data 
It's possible that a sensor sends a completely irrational value, which implies to a faulty sensor. If this error persists for multiple days, it is recommended to perform a complete **power cycle**.

##### Power cycle procedure:
1. Remove batteries.
2. Cover the solar panel so the station isn't powered by the panel while the batteries are out.
3. Press the reset button a few times to drain all stored power.
4. Wait a few minutes.
5. Put batteries back in place and wait for the station to boot up.

If the above doesn't work, you should contact our [support team](https://support.weatherxm.com)  for sensor replacement.

#### Spikes on Data 
One or more of your sensors are exhibiting irrational spikes. You should first check your station if it is optimally deployed and then you should contact [support](https://support.weatherxm.com). 
Take a look at our [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) and [Best Practices](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation) to ensure that your station is deployed correctly.



#### Constant Values 
One or more of your sensors report constant values which implies a bad installation, or less often, a problematic sensor. If your station is optimally installed and the constant value errors persist for a few days, 
you should perform a **power cycle** and if you continue to receive it, contact [support](https://support.weatherxm.com).

Take a look at our [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) and [Best Practices](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation) to ensure that your station is deployed correctly.

##### Power cycle procedure:
1. Remove batteries.
2. Cover the solar panel so the station isn't powered by the panel while the batteries are out.
3. Press the reset button a few times to drain all stored power.
4. Wait a few minutes.
5. Put batteries back in place and wait for the station to boot up.

If the above doesn't work, you should contact our [support team](https://support.weatherxm.com)  for sensor replacement.

#### Frozen Sensor
You should remove excess snow or ice from the weather station, and make sure wind cups and wind vanes rotate freely.



:::tip
If you encounter any errors, it is recommended that you observe it for a few days before reaching out to our [support team](https://support.weatherxm.com). 
In case you still receive the error after a couple of days, please do not hesitate to contact our [support team](https://support.weatherxm.com) for further guidance.

## Bad Station Deployment

It appears that your weather station could benefit from some improvements in terms of its deployment. The [Quality of Data (QoD) algorithm](/project/quality-of-data) evaluates all data packet received by a weather station every day, so a proper installation becomes mandatory to receive the maximum amount of rewards.
We recommend that you take a look at our [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) and [Best Practices](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation) for inspiration on how and where to install your station.



<hr/>

## No location Data

Your weather station was suspended from rewards because it did not report GPS data. Please check the troubleshooting guides for your station below, before contacting our support team.[support team](https://support.weatherxm.com). 

### For the WG1000 - WiFi gateway

1. [No location (GPS) data (arrow icon is red)](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#no-location-gps-data-arrow-icon-is-red)
2. [Place the WG1000 near a window (for better GPS signal)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-connect-and-claim#place-m5-near-a-window-for-better-gps-signal)

### For the WS-2000 (Helium version)

1. [No location (GPS) data](/helium-bundle/helium-troubleshooting#no-location-gps-data)
2. [Installation instructions](/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/helium-install-weather-station)

<hr/>

## Location Not Verified

It appears that the location of your weather station is different from the one you had originally set while claiming it. 
Please verify your location through the mobile app.
<div class="explanation small-big">
 <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/project/settings.png")} />
 <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/project/edit_location.png")} />
 <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/project/edit_location2.png")} />
</div>

In detail, the [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location) flagged your weather station because the location reported by its GPS receiver(s) is different than the location you declared during the setup and claiming of the station.

This could happen because either you have moved your station from its initial installation site, or you had declared a wrong location during the onboarding process of the station on your mobile app. 


As a result, your station will not be eligible for reward distribution until it is moved back to the declared location or the location is updated by using the "relocate station" function on your mobile app.

:::tip
When discussing the weather, we always mention a specific location, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, the data provided by weather stations in the WeatherXM Network is meaningless unless we know the location of each station at all times.
It is crucial for the stability of the Network to have weather stations that can report their current location and remain stationary.
:::

:::note
[Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location) penalty imposed to devices that went through a relocation is currently reduced to 2 days. This is a temporary measure and will be reverted back to 7 days.

<hr/>

## User Relocation Penalty

Our [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location) reported a relocation event. 
It seems like you used the relocation feature and you edited the location of your weather station through the app. Please wait 7 days and your weather station will start earning rewards again.

WeatherXM places great importance on station continuity, and discourage relocations therefore It is important for the Network that a station remains at the same location throughout its lifetime.

:::note
The [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location) penalty imposed to devices that went through a relocation is currently reduced to 2 days. This is a temporary measure and will be reverted back to 7 days.
