A guide to interpreting mobile app error messages, understanding their meanings, and taking appropriate actions to resolve them.

## No wallet

It seems that you haven't connected a wallet to your account yet. Please note that in order to receive rewards, you must connect a wallet address. Here's what you need to do:

1. Learn [how to add or edit a wallet address](/mobile-app/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address).
2. Then, follow the instructions for [joining Arbitrum One and see your $WXM tokens](/rewards/how-to-join-arbitrum-and-see-your-tokens).

Once you've completed the above steps, you'll be all set to claim your rewards. Please wait until the [Reward Mechanism (RM) ](/rewards/reward-mechanism) completes. This usually takes until the following day and see "[How to Claim Rewards](/rewards/rewards-claiming)" for further guidance.

## Bad Station Deployment

It appears that your weather station could benefit from some improvements in terms of its deployment. The [Data Quality algorithm](/rewards/data-quality) evaluates all data packet received by a weather station every day, so a proper installation becomes mandatory to receive the maximum amount of rewards.
We recommend that you take a look at our [Deployment Examples](/wxm-devices/deployment-examples) and [Best Practices](/wxm-devices/m5/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation) for inspiration on how and where to install your station.

## Location Not Verified

It appears that the location of your weather station is different from the one you had originally set while claiming it. 
Please verify your location through the mobile app.
<div class="explanation small-big">
 <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/rewards/settings.png")} />
 <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/rewards/edit-location.png")} />
 <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/rewards/edit-location-2.png")} />
</div>

In detail, the [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/rewards/proof-of-location) flagged your weather station because the location reported by its GPS receiver(s) is different than the location you declared during the setup and claiming of the station.

This could happen because either you have moved your station from its initial installation site, or you had declared a wrong location during the onboarding process of the station on your mobile app.

As a result, your station will not be eligible for reward distribution until it is moved back to the declared location or the location is updated by using the "relocate station" function on your mobile app.

:::tip
When discussing the weather, we always mention a specific location, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, the data provided by weather stations in the WeatherXM Network is meaningless unless we know the location of each station at all times.
It is crucial for the stability of the Network to have weather stations that can report their current location and remain stationary.

:::note
[Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/rewards/proof-of-location) penalty imposed to devices that went through a relocation is currently reduced to 2 days. This is a temporary measure and will be reverted back to 7 days.

## User Relocation Penalty

Our [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/rewards/proof-of-location) reported a relocation event.
It seems like you used the relocation feature and you edited the location of your weather station through the app. Please wait 7 days and your weather station will start earning rewards again.

WeatherXM places great importance on station continuity, and discourage relocations therefore It is important for the Network that a station remains at the same location throughout its lifetime.

:::note
The [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/rewards/proof-of-location) penalty imposed to devices that went through a relocation is currently reduced to 2 days. This is a temporary measure and will be reverted back to 7 days.
