A guide to interpreting mobile app error messages, understanding their meanings, and taking appropriate actions to resolve them.

## No wallet

It seems that you haven't connected a wallet to your account yet. Please note that in order to receive rewards, you must connect a wallet address. Here's what you need to do:

1. Learn [how to add or edit a wallet address](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address).
2. Then, follow the instructions for [joining Arbitrum Sepolia and see your $WXM tokens](/wallet/how-to-join-arbitrum-and-see-your-tokens#add-arbitrum-sepolia-network-to-metamask).

Once you've completed the above steps, you'll be all set to claim your rewards. Check back tomorrow and see "[How to Claim Rewards](/project/rewards-claiming)" for further guidance.

## No Station Data

It seems that your station did not transmit any data, which may indicate that it was either offline or not connected to the network.


Here's what you need to do:

### For the WS-1000 (WiFi/M5 version)

<div class="explanation">
   <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/project/m5-ui-new_numbered.jpg")} />
  <div>
    <h4>M5 icons explanation <br/> 
    Red=Problem, Green= Good</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>RF connection with the station.</li>
      <li>Connection to WeatherXM Network.</li>
      <li>GPS reciver.</li>
      <li>WiFi coneection.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

1. Check if the station's battery level is low through mobile app settings.
If the battery is low, the connection between your station and the M5 gateway will be unstable, resulting in data loss.
<div class="explanation small-big">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/project/settings_through_the_app.png")} />
  <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/project/battery_level.png")} />
</div>

2. Follow the Troubleshooting guide regarding [No WiFi connection](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#no-wifi--connection).
3. Check that your station connection (RF) to the gateway is stable by following the guide [here](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#weather-station-not-reporting-data-to-m5-miner-there-are-dashes----on-the-display-console).
4. Also read through the guide to add the included external antenna [here](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#my-station-does-not-connect-to-the-m5-miner).

### For the WS-2000 (Helium version)

1. Check if the station's battery level is low through mobile app settings.
2. Check for [Helium coverage](https://docs.weatherxm.com/helium-bundle/helium-troubleshooting#how-to-see-if-there-is-helium-coverage-in-your-area) in your area.

## Sensor Problems

We have discovered that the weather data packets did not meet our quality standards. 
To ensure the accuracy of the information sent by our weather stations, we evaluate all data packets using our Quality of Data (QoD) algorithm. For more information about this algorithm, please refer to this link. 
There reasons why you may be encountering this error, and they are as follows with the proposed asctions to take:

#### Out of bounds data 
OBC means that a sensor sends  a completely irrational value, which implies a faulty sensor. So, the user may need to contact [support](https://support.weatherxm.com)  for sensor replacement.

#### Spikes on data 
You should first check your station is optimally deployed and then you should contact [support ](https://support.weatherxm.com).

#### Constant values 
You should first check your station is optimally deployed and then you should contact [support ](https://support.weatherxm.com).

#### Frozen sensor
You should remove excess snow or ice from the weather station, and make sure wind cups and wind vanes rotate freely.


Take a look at our out our [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) and [Best Practices](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation) to ensure that your station is deployed correctly.
It is recommended that you observe it for a few days before reaching out to our [support team](https://support.weatherxm.com) if you encounter any errors. In case you still receive the error, please do not hesitate to contact our [support team](https://support.weatherxm.com) for further guidance.

## Weather Data Gaps
Some data gaps were detected during our data quality checks.
Indoor or outdoor units are not properly connected to the network, or to each other.

Here's what you need to do:

### For the WS-1000 (WiFi/M5 version)

<div class="explanation">
   <img src={useBaseUrl("/img/project/m5-ui-new_numbered.jpg")} />
  <div>
    <h4>M5 icons explanation <br/> 
    Red=Problem, Green= Good</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>RF connection with the station.</li>
      <li>Connection to WeatherXM Network.</li>
      <li>GPS reciver.</li>
      <li>WiFi coneection.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>

1. Check if the station's battery level is low through mobile app settings.
If the battery is low, the connection between your station and the M5 gateway will be unstable, resulting in data loss.

2. Follow the Troubleshooting guide regarding [No WiFi connection](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#no-wifi--connection).
3. Check that your station connection (RF) to the gateway is stable by following the guide [here](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#weather-station-not-reporting-data-to-m5-miner-there-are-dashes----on-the-display-console).

## Bad Station Deployment

It appears that your weather station could benefit from some improvements in terms of its deployment. We recommend that you take a look at our [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) and [Best Practices](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation) for inspiration on how and where to install your station
Proper installation is mandatory to receive the maximum amount of rewards.

Our QoD algorithm runs every day to evaluate your data. You can read more about this algorithm [here](/project/quality-of-data).

<hr/>

## No location Data

Your weather station was suspended from rewards because it did not report GPS data. Please check the troubleshooting guides for your station below, before contacting our support team.[support team](https://support.weatherxm.com). 

### For the WS-1000 (WiFi/M5 version)

1. [No location (GPS) data (arrow icon is red)](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#no-location-gps-data-arrow-icon-is-red)
2. [Place the M5 near a window (for better GPS signal)](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-connect-and-claim#place-m5-near-a-window-for-better-gps-signal)

### For the WS-2000 (Helium version)

1. [No location (GPS) data](/helium-bundle/helium-troubleshooting#no-location-gps-data)
2. [Installation instructions](/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/helium-install-weather-station)

<hr/>

## Location Not Verified

t appears that the location of your weather station is different from the one you had originally set while claiming it. 
Please verify your location through the mobile app (Station details -> Settings -> Edit Location)

In detail, the [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location) flagged your weather station because the location reported by its GPS receiver(s) is different than the location you declared during the setup and claiming of the station.

This could happen because either you have moved your station from its initial installation site, or you had declared a wrong location during the onboarding process of the station on your mobile app. 


As a result, your station will not be eligible for reward distribution until it is moved back to the declared location or the location is updated by using the "relocate station" function on your mobile app.

:::tip
When discussing the weather, we always mention a specific location, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, the data provided by weather stations in the WeatherXM Network is meaningless unless we know the location of each station at all times.
 It is crucial for the stability of the Network to have weather stations that can report their current location and remain stationary.
:::

:::note
During the beta phase and while the project is still on a test-net, the Proof of Location penalty imposed to devices that went through a relocation is reduced to 2 days for testing purposes

<hr/>

## User Relocation Penalty

Our [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location) reported a relocation event. 
It seems like you used the relocation feature and you edited the location of your weather station through the app. Please wait 7 days and your weather station will start earning rewards again.

During the beta phase and while the project is still on a test-net, the Proof of Location penalty imposed to devices that went through a relocation is reduced to 2 days for testing purposes.
