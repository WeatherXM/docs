### Overview

**Reward boosts** are additional rewards given to stations that contribute weather data during daily distribution, in addition to the [**base rewards**](/reward-mechanism#daily-rewards-calculation-process). Learn more about the daily rewards in the [Reward Mechanism (RM) ](/reward-mechanism) section.

**Reward Boosts** reward stations with extra $WXM tokens for meeting specific criteria. 

So far the following **Reward Boosts** are scheduled to be implemented:

### Beta Rewards

According to the [Token Allocation table](https://weatherxm.network/docs/wxm-token.html#token-allocation), 3M $WXM are reserved to reward stations that participated to the network before the Mainnet Launch Day ("Beta period").

Beta rewards distribution will last 425 days.

#### Calculation:

The following calculations will take place for each station, the day before the Mainnet Launch:

`RewardableBetaHours[s]`:
This is the total number of hours the station provided valid data during the Beta period.
A rewardable hour is an hour during which the station sent at least one valid weather data point.

`StationBetaRewards[s] = 3000000 * RewardableBetaHours[s]/Sum(RewardableBetaHours of all stations)`:
This is the percentage of the 3M tokens that correspond to the rewardable hours the station provided.

`DailyBetaRewards[s] = StationBetaRewards[s]/365`: This is the beta rewards allocated daily to this station.




:::info
Each user who has a station eligible for beta rewards, must have a wallet defined to be part of the Beta Rewards allocation. Learn [how to add or edit a wallet address](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address).

:::note
The Beta Rewards allocation is managed by the [WeatherXM Network](https://weatherxm.network).

### Cell Boost

Cell Boost is a mechanism that can be used to incentivise weather stations deployments on specific cells/areas of interest.


### Examples of reward programs that may be implemented using **Rewards Boost**, in the near future are:


- Backfill of rewards that were not allocated to certain devices due to malfunctions in the [Quality of Data (QoD) mechanism](/project/quality-of-data) or [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location).
- Public Goods Funding, for devices that are deployed and contribute to the network in a humanitarian way, such as providing data in an underserved area or during a specific time. 
- Devices that contribute to the network during a specific event, such as a natural disaster, may receive a boost in rewards.

:::tip
The **Reward boosts** is a mechanism that can be used to incentivise specific behavior from devices. It is a flexible mechanism that can be used to incentivise any behavior that is beneficial to the network.
