Hardware-Class Weight (HCW): HCW is a rational number > 0.

Each type of approved hardware (weather station) belongs to a specific Hardware Class.
Hardware Classes are used to award more tokens to weather stations that have special capabilities, 
increased sensor accuracy or range, new sensor types, or other capabilities that make them more valuable to the network.

:::note
For the time being all Hardware Classes are considered equal.
