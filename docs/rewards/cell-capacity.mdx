**Cell Capacity (CC)** is a parameter that is used to define the maximum number of stations that may receive rewards in a specific cell.


Each cell has a predetermined capacity that depends on its unique geospatial features. The capacity of a cell is the maximum number of weather stations that are eligible for rewards in that particular cell. 
If there are 'N' rewardable weather stations in a cell with a capacity of 'CC' on a given day, and if N exceeds CC, then only the first N stations 
(ordered first by their reward score, defined in the [Reward Mechanism (RM) ](/reward-mechanism) section, and then by seniority) will receive rewards.

### Last Claim Time (LCT): 
Claim time is a unix timestamp (integer).
Last Claim Time is set to the timestamp of the last claim of the station. It is used as a **seniority indicator** ( LCT1<LCT2 then station 1 is more senior than station 2).

### Cell Ranking:
Cell ranking is a way to measure how well a station performs compared to others within the same area, which is about 5 square kilometers (2 square miles) on the planet. Each station is ranked every day based on their reward score and seniority. 
If a station's ranking is above the capacity threshold, it will be rewarded. 
However, if the ranking falls below the threshold, the station won't receive any rewards. For instance, in a cell with a maximum capacity of 5 stations, a station that is ranked 3rd would be rewarded, but a station ranked 7th would not receive any rewards.
