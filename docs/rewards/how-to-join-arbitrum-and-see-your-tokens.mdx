## Add WXM token in MetaMask

For the WXM token to appear in the wallet UI, you will need to add it manually.
Note that your wallet can still receive tokens that haven’t been imported.

:::note IMPORTANT NOTE
Please make sure you have already added the **Arbitrum One** and have connected to it by following the guide above!
:::

1. First, you will need the following details of the WXM token in order to add it:
    1. **Token Contract Address:** ``0xB6093B61544572Ab42A0E43AF08aBaFD41bf25A6``
    1. **Token Symbol:** ``WXM``

    You can verify those details on [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xb6093b61544572ab42a0e43af08abafd41bf25a6).
1. On MetaMask and click **[Import tokens]**.
1. Paste in the WXM’s contract address and MetaMask should automatically fill in the rest of the details. If not, add them manually. To finish, click **[Add Custom Token]**.
