### Bridging Your Assets from Ethereum to Arbitrum:
 1. Go to https://bridge.arbitrum.io/
 2. Then, simply enter the amount of ETH you wish to use on Arbitrum and click “Deposit”. 
 3. Next, you will need to confirm the transaction in your wallet. Please note that this transaction is on Layer 1 and standard gas fees will apply. 
 However, once on Arbitrum you can enjoy lower gas fees. Once the amount is correct, click “Confirm”
 4. Once confirmed, you will see the transaction appear and process at the bottom of your screen. This can take a few minutes.
 5. If you require additional support to bridge your assets, you can refer to Arbitrum’s tutorial [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/getting-started-users).

 **This Guide is only on desktop with the MetaMask browser extension already installed.**
