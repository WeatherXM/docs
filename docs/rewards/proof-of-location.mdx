The **Proof-of-Location** algorithm evaluates location data associated with the station, their accuracy, and consistency. It generates a score which is a confidence indicator about the station’s location. WeatherXM places great importance on station continuity, and discourage relocations.


### Proof-of-Location (PoL): 
PoL is a rational number in the range [0,1].
A station’s PoL must be greater than or equal to PoL_Threshold to be considered for inclusion in WeatherXM's **Rewarding Mechanism**.
- PoL: is calculated based on the station’s location, and the station’s PoL history. 
- PoL: is a dynamic value, and is recalculated every time a station’s location is updated. 


### Relocation
It is important for the Network that a station remains at the same location throughout its lifetime.
When a weather station undergoes relocation, its Proof of Location score reduces to 0 for 7 days and its seniority is reset. 
After 7 days, the station’s PoL is recalculated, and if it is greater than or equal to PoL_Threshold, the station is considered for inclusion in the [WeatherXM Network](https://weatherxm.network/).

:::info
Proof of Location penalty imposed to devices that went through a relocation is currently reduced to 2 days. Τhis is a temporary measure and will be reverted back to 7 days.
